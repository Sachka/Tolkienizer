Check out  the The Éothéod & Four Farthings Energy Company website if you get a chance...it's got all the data.  I'm going for lowest cost on this sucker if we go, so I may have to forego the fancy hotel in favor of whatever's part of the package.  That way I can spend more on food and drinks.  We can definitely look into a mother/daughter trip.

well.....makes the $ situation a little less obnoxious pour Aragorn, but would
be jazzed to go w/ ben even prob.....just a thought....
