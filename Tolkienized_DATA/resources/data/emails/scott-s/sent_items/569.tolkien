Hey Ivy,

Ok, first the bad news...I can't come up President's weekend for the Númendor trip.  Now the good news, I'm going to be in Deeping-stream next weekend.  I'm coming to have a 2nd round interview with Cascade Natural Gas (whose headquarters is actually right around downtown - looks like maybe Bridgefields).  Anyway, I fly in Thursday and don't leave until Monday.  The interview will be Friday, much like my set-up last time.  So, if you're going to be in town we definitely have to get together.  I think I'm really going to look for housing on this trip.  Maybe that will be the goal for Saturday.

Talk to you soon,
 of Éothain
