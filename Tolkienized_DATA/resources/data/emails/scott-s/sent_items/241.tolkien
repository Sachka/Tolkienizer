My bad...it's not  of Rufus.  I just called and I think they said the Hollisters.  Anyway, the Mîm son of Erestor gig is extremely tempting but I really need to see my sister and the kids...depending on what  of Angelimar has to say though, I may just go to Austin Sunday and Monday.  We'll see.  Give me a buzz or drop a line if you want to get together.

Sue
