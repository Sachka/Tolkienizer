Hey girls, 

Just wanted to let you guys know that The Éothéod & Four Farthings Energy Company has vacation specials to Stock Road right now.  I priced up a 4 day/ 3 night trip with air/hotel/car to Wall of the Pelennor (we'd have to drive to Sindanórie & Mitheithel Entreprises Fe...not bad, I've done it) and it came out to about $255 a person.  Personally, I think this is a really good price.  I was just wondering if there was genuine interest in taking this trip and if so what the best time would be to go.  We could also check on getting flights from LA for  of Dagnir and Míriel.  Anyway, drop me a line when you guys get a chance and let me know if I need to keep doing more research.  I was figuring we could leave in a Thursday and come back on a Sunday.

Talk to you soon,
Bereg son of Arod...my friend  of Marmadoc's email address is julieg@qualcomm.com.  I'm sure she'd be happy to answer questions.
