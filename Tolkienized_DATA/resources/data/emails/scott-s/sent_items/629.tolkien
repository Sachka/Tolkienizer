hey Erendis,

sorry i've been Asphodel of late.  i want to play catch-up with you, but i'm afraid i'd wear myself out typing.  i was wondering if there was a good time for me to call (either during the day or after-work).  let me know.

hope all is going well.

Minto - i was wondering if anyone is throwing you a bridesmaid's luncheon the weekend of your wedding?
