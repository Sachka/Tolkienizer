sounds good....i'd rather be useless a day at work, than miss a day over there....in the grand scheme of life.

 of Haldan,
Haven't bought your tickets yet, but have a feeling I won't be able to do anything about you getting in at 9:00pm Sunday.  I will ask though.  You should be leaving on Tuesday and returning to Halls of Waiting on Sunday (and leaving Mountains of Moria on Sunday).  The total air fare should be $962.  Shoot me a quick e mail if this is not ok.  Otherwise, I will plan on purchasing your tickets this afternoon.  Thanks!
