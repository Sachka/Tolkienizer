forgot to tell you....

talked to DaisyCotton yesterday and...she and Mount Gundabad & Bralda-hîm Energy Company got engaged on the 28th.  she's very excited and sounded genuinely happy.  just thought i'd fill you in some good news.  and, yes, i do think it's a good thing.

also, i'm sure Zimrahin sent you an email...but, yesterday was her last day w/ ENE.  i'm truly thrilled for her too.  i think this is going to be a very good thing.
