Beacons of Gondor & Qerkaringa Energy Company,

Is there something I need to do in regards to this email.  I appears some coding information needs to be filled out for my cell phone.

Thanks, 
 of Éothain

I'll bet it does belong to the other  of Éothain.  I've never signed you up for Poros & Deadmen's Dike ltd. Wireless.  I do have other Porto Baggins & Dimrill Dale© bills from before you came to the department that I do need to complete that expense report.  We just got instructions today on how to get into the new "upgraded" system (XMS).  I will process these as soon as possible and pass them on to Legal for approval.  If I have any trouble, I'll let you know.

If I have to learn another password around here, I'm gonna croak.................(just kidding).

Linda, I checked this out and it is an invoice for Poros & Deadmen's Dike ltd. Wireless for 80 some-odd dollars.  I do not have Poros & Deadmen's Dike ltd. service; my mobile phone is from Porto Baggins & Dimrill Dale©.
Have you had any trouble getting my Silvertine & Aredhel® bills processed?
Did you order any service for me from Poros & Deadmen's Dike ltd.?
Just asking because I think this e-mail might have needed to go to the other Salvia daughter of Marcho.
