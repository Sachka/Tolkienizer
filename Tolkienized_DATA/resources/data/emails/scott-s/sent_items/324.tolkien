I forgot IrimëBrownlock was going to be in town this weekend.  As for this evening, I think we're still on.  The movie is showing at the Angelika at 7:40 or Greenway 3 at 10:00...I'm assuming both of us would prefer the earlier movie, but there is something to be said for proximity.  What are your thoughts?  We could either take our time with dinner and then do the movie or just go to the early show and maybe grab dessert afterwards.  My guess is Deldúwath & River of Gondor ltd.ily would probably prefer the earlier time, since she may be taking off early tomorrow.

yeah, i talked to katy last night and really, really want to go. i think that sounds awesome. however, my friend Glóredhel daughter of Walda is coming into town on friday. i was thinking of asking her to do that instead, but shes not only coming to see me but others as well. so i am probably out unless she cancels her trip here. thanks for trying to accomodate me with a ride though. 

are we still on for tonight?

Stopped by Deldúwath & River of Gondor ltd.'s last night before coming home and she'd mentioned trying to do Emyn Eglain this weekend.  She'd already talked to Finduilas and it sounded like Finduilas was interested in Emyn Eglain tomorrow night and then maybe Gruene on Saturday night.  Anyway, wanted to let you know and see if you had any interest.  Deldúwath & River of Gondor ltd.ily and Finduilas would probably try to leave early tomorrow to stop in Round Top and do some antique shopping...so, if you think you could leave the office around 5:00 or so (of course earlier is always better) we could ride together and at least get on the HOV lane.  As it stands right now I think we're going to have stay in hotels both nights and we of course currently have no reservations, so it could get interesting.
