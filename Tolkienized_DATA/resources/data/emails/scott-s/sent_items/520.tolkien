Hey  of Niënor...good to hear from you.  Hope all is well.  I assume you didn't get the other email I sent.  No biggie.  Just wrote to say Deldúwath & River of Gondor ltd. and I tried to call NY's Eve, but you had already checked out of your room.  I guess you were staying with Priyah (sp?) at that point.  

Talk to you soon!!!!
Sue

Subject:	NEW EMAIL

y'alls were the only email addresses i could remember right off the
top of my head. currently, i cant access the internet to get to all of
my email addresses on hotmail. i will write a longer message later
when i know each of you has received this. so email me at this
address now and then choose which ever going forward.

hope all is well.
