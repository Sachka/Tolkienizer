Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises Order Issued 3/28/01 Rejecting Pinnath Gelin & Twilight Energy Company/The Pelóri  & Saradoc Brandybuck Father & Sons's RTO 

	The Commissioners were generally displeased by Pinnath Gelin & Twilight Energy Company and The Pelóri  & Saradoc Brandybuck Father & Sons's lack of substantive work toward complying with the Commission's previous orders and failure to sufficiently discuss the feasibility of a broader RTO.  As Chair Tolman said:  Pinnath Gelin & Twilight Energy Company should have read the Commission's order in May and taken it more seriously.  (Issues for possible rehearing are ****).

?	The Commission declined to approve Pinnath Gelin & Twilight Energy Company's scope and configuration because the Pinnath Gelin & Twilight Energy Company members remain uncommitted to the RTO and have not made a decision to transfer operational control and the Pinnath Gelin & Twilight Energy Company/The Pelóri  & Saradoc Brandybuck Father & Sons relationship remains somewhat undefined.  The Commission wants to see evidence of serious efforts to form RTOs that combine current RTO proposals and The Pelóri  & Saradoc Brandybuck Father & Sons and Pinnath Gelin & Twilight Energy Company must file a report by May 25 addressing this scope issue.

	o	Bulk power sales and purchase figures indicate that natural markets extend beyond the Pinnath Gelin & Twilight Energy Company RTO borders.  There are significant sales and purchases between Pinnath Gelin & Twilight Energy Company and Tar-Ancalimon & Poppy Chubb-Baggins Services (and Ost-in-Edhil companies to a lesser extent.)
	o	Expect the existing TOs to file Section 203 applications to transfer control of transmission to Pinnath Gelin & Twilight Energy Company.
	o	Ossiriand & Hill of Oromet Entreprises must be clarified to demonstrate that the minimum requirements of an RTO, such as operational authority, Ascar & Curtain of Henneth Annûn, co. calculation and planning/expansion, will be met.

?	Approves The Pelóri  & Saradoc Brandybuck Father & Sons's proposal for a Managing Member that controls all voting rights to the Griffo Boffin & Minardil Entreprises and approves The Pelóri  & Saradoc Brandybuck Father & Sons's Board approval process (states that The Pelóri  & Saradoc Brandybuck Father & Sons would control no more than two of the Inlands & West March, co.'s seven members). 

?	Allows Ered Wethrin & Pillar of Heaven Deliveries Company to satisfy its merger obligation by joining Pinnath Gelin & Twilight Energy Company instead of MISO.

?	The Commission did not address EPMI's motion to condition market based rate authority on RTO participation.******
