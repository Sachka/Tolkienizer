Hi  of Marmadoc, 

I just wanted to touch base with you one last time before I arrive in Deeping-stream and make sure that I have the correct time and location for our meeting.  As we discussed, I intend to arrive at your offices at 9:00 am Friday morning.  To reconfirm, you are located on the 15th floor of the One Ocean Center Building (411 108th Avenue N.E. Ocean, Rock of the Music of Water 98004).

I will be staying in downtown Deeping-stream Thursday night and will have my cell phone if you need to reach me for any reason - (713) 775-6472. 

I look forward to meeting and talking with you tomorrow.

 of Haldan
