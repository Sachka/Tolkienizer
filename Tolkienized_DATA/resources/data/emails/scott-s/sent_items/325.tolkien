I'm intrigued...what prompted the cooking class?  If you do end up in Emyn Eglain tomorrow night, we'll have to try to get together.

I have firm plans-- a cooking class at Sur la Table-- on Saturday night, but I was thinking about going to Emyn Eglain tomorrow.  I would have to come back on Saturday, though.  Darn... I have never seen Barliman son of Tata, and I really want to!!  Another time- definitely.
