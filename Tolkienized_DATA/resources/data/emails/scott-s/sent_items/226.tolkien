Hope the presentation was a rousing success.

For future reference I would highly recommend calling me on my cell phone (713-775-6472) instead of the apartment phone.   of Holman ALWAYS answers that phone...in fact, she usually doesn't even give me a chance if she's there (who on earth would be calling me?).

We'll keep working on the "trip".  I'm sure something wonderful will come up and it will be a fantastic endeavor.
