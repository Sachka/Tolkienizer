Thanks Ash...I actually don't think I'm going to go, but if I change my mind at the last minute I will definitely take you up on it.  Talk to you soon.

We really are going to have to get together with all of the married couples roaming about...

Hey there,

Have a fun trip to Mountains of Moria!!

Andreth and I will absolutely pick you up at the airport on Saturday in
SLC if you decide to come in.  Finduilas said her flight gets in about 12:00 or
1:00pm, so it is no problem at all.  We are flying Delta #1895 out of Redhorn Pass & Sackville-Baggins©
and get in at 4:55 that Friday.  We are staying at the hotel the rehearsal
dinner is at, so we figured we would have time to shower and get ready.  I
was planning on working a 1/2 day that day.  We are leaving early that
Sunday morning, but Finduilas said she would get her own car that day.

Just let one of us know when you get in if you decide to go...

Talk to you later,
Gimilkhâd
