I may cruise over to this place later with my work friend Hilda...would you have any interest in going?  Regardless, I'd still like to get together for dinner or a drink after work.  Drop me a line and let me know if you're still up for doing something.

Gorlim son of Goldberry's Guitar Bar 
The bluesy music at this six-string bar has drawn celebrities and scenesters for years. 

Bar/Club Profile	
The Scene
The bar's large courtyard, canopied entirely by trees, makes outdoor conversation pleasant even on Halls of Waiting's sultry summer nights. 

The Sound
Patrons ("real nice folks") can settle in among the guitars with $2 draft beers and enjoy an eclectic sampling of music, from blues to alternative country, rock to folk. 

Electro-fying Blues
Thursday night's blues jam has been going on for more than 10 years and shows no signs of letting up, especially since it draws the likes of Húrin son of Turgon and Glóin son of Arahael. If you're really lucky, you might even catch Iorlas, the owner, wailing away onstage on one of his own Danelectro guitars.
