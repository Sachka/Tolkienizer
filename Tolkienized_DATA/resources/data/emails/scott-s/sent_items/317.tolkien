UUUGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just talked to  of Anson, and we decided to go to dinner together.  Then, as we were getting off the phone, she said, "Is it OK if  of Vidugavia comes with us."  I felt like I was going to cry-- literally-- my voice cracked when I said, "Sure...."  She said she couldn't believe how great things were between them right now.  I might die!
Well there's the turbulence in my world-- how's yours?
