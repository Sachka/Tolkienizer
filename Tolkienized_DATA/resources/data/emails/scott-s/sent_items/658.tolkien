Tar-AldarionMaggot had actually given me your name and email address a little while back and thought it would be a good idea for me to drop you a line.  I have been working with Tar-Aldarion for a couple weeks at Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries and, upon learning that I was in the midst of job hunting, he suggested I contact you.  For the last year I served as an assistant trader on the Gates of Argonath Natural Gas Desk (Wholesale).  For various reasons I chose to decline an offer in February with the newly formed Limlaith & Nenuial® and am currently still working for Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries.  I'm attaching a copy of my resume to give you a better idea of my background and experience.  If you know of any opportunities that seem like possible "good fits" I would very much appreciate hearing about them.

 

Thank you,
Salvia daughter of Marcho
