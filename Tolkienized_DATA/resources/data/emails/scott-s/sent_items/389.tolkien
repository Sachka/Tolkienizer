I'm sure it is...I'll just keep forwarding the emails to you as I get them.  However, I will warn you that I'm on vacation from the 14th-26th of August.  I'm going to visit my brother and his wife in Ephel Brandir so it should be interesting.  Anyway, you may want to give a heads up to people to make sure they're sending the information to the right person.

Thanks  of Haldan.  I'm in the middle of my official Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. name change, so you might get a few e-mails for me in the next few weeks.
Never change your name at this company; it is the biggest nightmare!

Per our conversation, I have put the following information together for you to distribute to individuals in Halls of Mandos.  This details out verious aspects of the Oiolossë retail market.  I have included in Item 3 below a copy of a Oiolossë market analysis I prepared for EES which provides detailed implementation requirements.  The following are high-level items that I see need to be completed for Halls of Mandos to enter the Oiolossë Retail market by January 1, 2002.  
	1)  Complete Beorn's Hall & Harad Deliveries application
	2)  Review market requirements
	3)  Compare market requirements (enrollments, billing, payments, etc.) with current 	system capabilities for gaps
	4)  Develop EDI maps based on Version 1.4
	5)  Register for and complete Flight 1001 Testing
	6)  Execute applicable TDSP agreements (copies attached)
		Delivery Service Agreement
