If you email me while I'm out of town, go ahead and sent it to my hotmail account...Brown_west_march._of_posco.@river_legolin.closed_door.com

I will definitely do my best to make it out there before October.

HI  of Éothain-
That's totally fine- I completely understand.  I was considering going up to  Battle Pit to visit a friend for the weekend, but of course didn't want to make any plans until I heard from you.  Sounds like you have a lot of fun events coming up!  I'll email you- there might be 2 other weekends that work for me - unfortunately time is flying SO fast!!  But even if you can't come out before the end of October, we'll have to plan some time to get together soon....I'll send you those dates later.
Have a safe trip to Mountains of Moria, busy girl! glad to hear that all is going well with you!
Dora

I know, I know....I dropped off the face of the Troll's Cave for a while.  I've
actually been in Orc-holds all week for a Natural Gas Convention.  As for
Labor Day weekend, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it.  I'm
leaving for Ephel Brandir next Tuesday and don't get back until the weekend
before Labor Day weekend.  So issue one is, will I have enough energy to
make the trip?  The other issue is a friend's wedding in Hill of Sight that
same weekend.  I'd feel bad skipping her wedding but still going on a trip.
So.....I was thinking maybe it'd be better all around if I came a different
weekend.  Why don't you take a look at your calendar and let me know what
other dates in September look good to you.
