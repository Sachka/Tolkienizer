I think this was intended for the other Berylla daughter of Folca.

Thanks

Lalia -- I used to have a link to the West Beleriand & Golden Wood Energy Company. Secretariat database -- has all the vital stats on all Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. entities.
Can you find out how to access it, as I seem to have lost the intranet site info I used to have.  It would really come in handy on this bid Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company filing I'm trying to get done.  Merci!
