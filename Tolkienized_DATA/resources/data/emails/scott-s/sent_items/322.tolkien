Stopped by Deldúwath & River of Gondor ltd.'s last night before coming home and she'd mentioned trying to do Emyn Eglain this weekend.  She'd already talked to  of Borlad and it sounded like  of Borlad was interested in Emyn Eglain tomorrow night and then maybe Gruene on Saturday night.  Anyway, wanted to let you know and see if you had any interest.  Deldúwath & River of Gondor ltd.ily and  of Borlad would probably try to leave early tomorrow to stop in Round Top and do some antique shopping...so, if you think you could leave the office around 5:00 or so (of course earlier is always better) we could ride together and at least get on the HOV lane.  As it stands right now I think we're going to have stay in hotels both nights and we of course currently have no reservations, so it could get interesting.
