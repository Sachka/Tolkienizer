Hello to all!

I hope that you are all having a great week!  I know that some of you have
been asking so I wanted to let you know that I think the big day is finally
set ( keep your fingers crossed and hope it doesn't rain).  So everyone
mark March 23, 2002 on your calendar!!!

Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you soon!
Caycie
