Guthláf!!!!!......i was deceased, but i have arisen from the ashes....HOW ARE YOU?

I want to hear all about the Water and how you are fairing there.  If i can manage, it I'd love to make a trip over there and see your pad, etc.  Sorry you never managed to meet up with Angelica, but she was actually in the Tharbad when you emailed and then only back in East Emnet for about a week to pack up and head home.  So you need to give me a kind of schedule for where you're going to be and when...(Ferumbras Took & Gorgoroth, co. vs. Tharbad for holidays and what not).

If you have a Messenger account let me know...i'd love to chat "real-time" with you.

Baldor:  I'll be in Ered Lithui mid-November for work...if you happen to be home then, I'd love to see you...otherwise, any suggestions would be much welcomed.

Are you still alive? What's the word? Westfold Vale is grand, though I am gone so
much I wouldn't really know what's going on here...
Drop a note as you have time. I tried to contact Emily but alas she has not
returned my call, must be quite busy she is!
Let me know if we have a connection.....

Tobes
