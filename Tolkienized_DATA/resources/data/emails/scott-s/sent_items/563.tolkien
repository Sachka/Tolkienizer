I recently had the following wine at Wahso in Hill of Sight, East Osgiliath - Window of the West...
991211200 Zilliken 1999 Saarburger Smaug Sp?tlese 17 750ml 
I was wondering if you could tell me of a distributor or retailer from whom the wine might be purchased.  I currently reside in Halls of Waiting, Bree-land but will be making a trip to Deeping-stream, WA in the next couple weeks.

Thank you,
Salvia daughter of Marcho
