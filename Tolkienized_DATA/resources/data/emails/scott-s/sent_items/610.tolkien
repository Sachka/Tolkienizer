Ivy....How was the weekend??????  Very curious to see what you crazy girls did up there in Númendor.  

So, I wanted to let you know that Puget called me last Friday with another job opening.  I'm supposed to talk to the guy today regarding the position.  I certainly don't want to get my hopes up...but I'm kind of excited about this being something I could actually like.  

Hope all is well with you and I'll let you know how my phone call goes today.

Talk to you soon,
 of Éothain

Btw...messengered with Halmir son of Hayward, I guess things are back to "normal" - whatever that is.

hi there:
how are you doing? have you told the company anything yet? i am thinking you probably had to turn ole pattie down... was she devestated that you won't be her new BFF?

let me know how it went, and i hope things are going well on the whole "looking for a job" front. I know it can be so frustrating.

have you spoken with Goldwine????  any more updates with that?

happy valentines (even though it is a dumb holiday)

Take care
Anairë
