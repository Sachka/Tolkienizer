Per our conversation, I have put the following information together for you to distribute to individuals in Halls of Mandos.  This details out verious aspects of the Oiolossë retail market.  I have included in Item 3 below a copy of a Oiolossë market analysis I prepared for EES which provides detailed implementation requirements.  The following are high-level items that I see need to be completed for Halls of Mandos to enter the Oiolossë Retail market by January 1, 2002.

	2)  Review market requirements
	3)  Compare market requirements (enrollments, billing, payments, etc.) with current 	system capabilities for gaps
	4)  Develop EDI maps based on Version 1.4
	5)  Register for and complete Flight 1001 Testing
	6)  Execute applicable TDSP agreements (copies attached)
		Delivery Service Agreement
