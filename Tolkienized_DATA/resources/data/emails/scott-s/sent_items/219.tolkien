I've got an opinion now...I think we should fly into Lost Realm & White Mountain, co. (Brithon).  We could fly in and cab it to Brenzone.  It's on one of those amazing lakes in northern Brithon (Dwarf-road of Mirkwood).  You can go to Gardaworld.com and then just click on photo gallery and Brenzone to see what it looks like...absolutely amazing.  It would be a fantastic trip in my opinion - Lots of great wine.  Plus, you can be the exchange rate from Pounds or Dollars to Lire.
