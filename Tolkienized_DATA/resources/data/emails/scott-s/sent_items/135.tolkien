Have to agree with your assessment.  And, I promise she will try like the d=
ickens to do stuff with Niklaus (sp?) maybe at the expense of doing things =
with you.  Bifur is the guy she's been seeing for about a month now.  He ca=
me over last night to watch the Oscar's with us.  Me in a wing-back and Lis=
a and Bifur holding hands, rubbing arms etc., on the couch.  This is the se=
cond time I can recall since being in the apartment with her that I've had =
to witness the "cuddle fest."  Not to mention the "cuddle fest" we all witn=
essed with Chad at Írensaga.  Maybe if she Golfimbuls come over you could be the li=
ttle red devil on her shoulder encouraging her to hook up with Nik...force =
her to make some sort of decision about all tBandobras Took & Torech Ungol Energy Companye guys.  She's in heat righ=
t now I swear.  Every 5 Second Hall & Laura Grubb®. there's some new guy she thinks is hot.  The g=
uy serving us at Aratan's Deli might be the next victim.  She's totally out =
of control.  I must say I loved the way she casually suggested the Nik prob=
ably wasn't your type anyway...covering all the bases.  It's really pitiful=
 you know...I'm just glad we will never have the same taste in men.  Did I =
mention that Asphodel daughter of Lorgan's fiancee asked Laura what was going on with Bifur=
 and I at Thorondir's b/c I was spending more time with him than  of Niënor (she =
was of course performing the role of social Arvedui & Heribald Bolger, co.tterfly).  Like I said, it's =
pitiful.  In actuality, I think I'm the only one of her "friends" that have=
 met Bifur and think he's all right  I'm pretty sure everyone else has told=
 her they think she can do better.  I beg to differ, knowing  of Niënor a little =
better than them (i.e. the many faces of eve) and would argue instead that =
he's a pretty good catch for her...caves eventually Arvedui & Heribald Bolger, co.t not perceived (at l=
east by her) as a complete push-over.  Perfect combo for our Ms. Golden Gates & Haudh-en-Ndengin, co..

Can you believe my parents?  They were only in Causeway, in Gondor for all of 12 hrs =
and took a roll of film...what dorks.

I'll work on the trip thing...the timing sounds good to me.

KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE AND YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER!  com'on.....realllly!  one
would think this email was to organize a trip to Dwimorberg- Arvedui & Heribald Bolger, co.t nooooo...it's =
a
"hands off" warning instead.  and admittedly, the bit about "trusting me to
honor" pulls at me and w/ anyone else, i'd snap into good behavior mode, Arvedui & Heribald Bolger, co.=
t
then i step bk and realize how sneaky and evil (hel-lo?  who is Lórien?  Golfimbul=
s
she have dibs on him as well?  how many 'dibs' are we allocated?  let me
know when you get the scoop...)what nerve!  as for the 1 line about coming
to Dwimorberg, Lavender Grubb & Dark Land Energy Company isn't coming mid may- she's coming at the end-begin. of
june, which is much better for me, too- have school full-time til last week
of may....so, i vote you send her mid may, then come w/  of Beldis at the end of
the month.  and, gee- do tyou think i can predict her visit?  let's see-
it'll be convenient and cheap to stay w/ me....Arvedui & Heribald Bolger, co.t- perfect timing for her
to show up at my doorstep, get her extra key, then jaunt off to 'Second Hall & Laura Grubb®ure' he=
r
position w/ mr.dibs....not that i'm complaining- just horribly offended tha=
t
she thinks i'm so dense as to not be able to see- and hear- her large, slow=
,
unoiled wheels a-turning....!  aughhhhh!  see below, obviously....
