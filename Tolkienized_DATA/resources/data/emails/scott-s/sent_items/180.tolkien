It was indeed an area bequeathed with natural beauty and with minimal pollution. When the pictures come out I will be sure to let you see them. I arrived back at 2am last night - I actually feel good now, which is rather odd given the general level of exertion the past few days. Yet it had been too long since I sat in front of a fire away from civilization as we know it and passed around a bottle of whiskey. Very therapeutic for the soul. Now it is time for some more Enron therapy once again, for an indefinate period of time... Perhaps you would be interested in going out with Gardner and myself on Thursday to the front porch? That is another form of therapy that I quite enjoy...

Enjoy your day,

Anardil

Sorry I didn't return your call last week.  I actually didn't check my voice mail until Friday after work and thus saw little point in calling back as you were probably in some remote area of pristine, scenic beauty by that time.  Hope the camping trip was a rousing success and allowed you to reconnect with your old friends and old self.  I am in desperate need of natural beauty and negligible pollution but have alas been trapped in Halls of Waiting the past couple of weekends.  I see a road trip in the not too distant future for myself, if only to get a way for a while.
