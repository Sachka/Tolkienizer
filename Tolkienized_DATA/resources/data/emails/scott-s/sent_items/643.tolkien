Just wanted to let you know that I'm flying in Sunday evening for an interview on Monday.  Goldilocks and I are talking about going out to dinner, nothing big, and were wondering if you might have any interest.  Let me know your thoughts and if I don't here back from you via email I'll just try giving you a buzz this weekend.  Hope things are going well.
