I'm sure she knows you're CC'd her on the email...she wants you to witness the flirtation.  She told me about the exchange last night and was wondering how he got your email address.  I told her I sent it to him.  She said, "I didn't think you knew his last name?"  To which I responded, "I didn't , but I called you and got it remember...I thought I told you I was emailing him to give him Emily's email address.  I'd promised him at Anardil's that  I'd send it when I got the chance."

 of Holman was none to pleased with me...she wants you to have nothing to do with him, but I told her she has to share the wealth and quite being such a boy hog.  I promised her we'd find her a new boy toy closer to home.  Speaking of which, she and Gildor had the "let's just be friends talk" last week ( which I think was the right move ).  

Glad you got some good sleep last night, but we need to chat when you get the chance (and not while I'm at work), so give me a call on the cell phone sometime.  Nothing bad, just a good little story.

Sue

does she know i'm CC on this?  think you may be busted for passing on the
email....i know you're scared.  am glad Almiel is capapble of explaining the
intricacies of my mind to strangers- particularly my penchant for
streotypes.  screw Dor Firn-i-Cúarthol  & Walls of the Night Energy Company- this girl needs to become a psychologist!  all
this time we sat w/ matt in your living room she was merely OBSERVING
queitly...and has nailed me!  we've benn WRONG sue!  am glad to find out
about my hostessing duties via a CC email- should i bust her on this?  could
be very gratifying.  am now wondering why i was being so shy and considerate
in my 1st email- THIS is the stuff that MAKES me want to taunt!  see below,
obviously.
