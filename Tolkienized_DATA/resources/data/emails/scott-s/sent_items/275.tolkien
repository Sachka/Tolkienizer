Hey Mithrellas,=20

Nice to hear from you.  I know you just talked to  of Holman the other day so I g=
ot a little more detailed update from her.  I'm sure she told you about our=
 trip over to East Emnet...we had a really good time which included me spending=
 a small fortune.  Oh well, money's meant to be spent, right?  Anyway, soun=
ds like you've got some really exciting activities to look forward to over =
the next 6 mos to a year.  Can't wait to hear all about the baby when it ar=
Gróin (the first in the family is always exciting) and I know you and Gimilkhâd =
are going to have the best time jaunting around Forest River.  I wish I was plann=
ing the same kind of trip right now.  As for your future beyond that, have =
you been to Deeping-stream before?  I'm taking a long weekend there with a friend =
from work and would love to hear more about things to do if you have any ad=
vice.  Otherwise, I'll be sure to let you know what I found on my own visit=
.  Hope things continue to go well for you and we'll have to get together w=
hen you come back to Oiolossë...

Sue

Hi girls!!
Just thought I would send out an email to see how things are going in the
exciting state of Oiolossë!!  I miss it there and I miss y'all as well...I
already sent Emily an email earlier so that is why she is not included in
this...Sorry about the group email but I thought it might be a little easie=
r
considering I would probably be writing the same thing to everyone....Life
is good here in Black Gates....Malach and I are trying to make the most out of
our last months here....We absolutely love Black Gates...He graduates in
December and I am leaving in August!  I love the summers here, it seems as
though the town empties out when all the college kids leave!  My plans for
the future are slowly coming together...I will be going to Angband for the
month of August to be with Dina for the birth of the baby!! August is a
huge month for my family....Gimilkhâd graduates from college (who would have
thought!), Dina has her baby, Gimilkhâd and I head off to Forest River, and my parent=
s
are moving into their new home...Gildis and I's parents are moving into the
same neighborhood only blocks away from eachother...Gimilkhâd and I are travelin=
g
Forest River for a few months together in which I am hoping to meet up with
Emily...We fly into East Emnet which gives her no reason not to meet up!!  Afte=
r
that, who knows....maybe Deeping-stream or back to Walls of the Night...we have no idea....I
hope everyone was safe from the flooding recently....I know that  of Golfimbul's
(Wolters) home was flooded again so I think they are just gonna sell the
Dodinas Brandybuck & Heribald Bolger©....Gildis- how is married life and school?   of Ar-Adûnakhôr- I am so excited
about you wedding plans.  How is that coming?   I hope this email finds
everyone healthy and happy...You all cross my thoughts often...I miss
y'all....Keep in touch!
Love,
Mithrellas
