sorry, i thought i told you that i was going to the Cobas Haven & Wold Father & Sons game last night with Arien.  it was interesting.  tonight i may be going over to Madoc's with priya for dinner, but i will be home before to shower and clean up after i work out.  did we decide on dinner or just drinks tomorrow night?  either is fine with me.
