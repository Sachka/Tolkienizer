sorry, i thought i told you that i was going to the South Kingdom & Towers of Gondor ltd. game last night with Hundar.  it was interesting.  tonight i may be going over to Flambard's with priya for dinner, but i will be home before to shower and clean up after i work out.  did we decide on dinner or just drinks tomorrow night?  either is fine with me.
