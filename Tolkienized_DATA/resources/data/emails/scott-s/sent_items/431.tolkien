odds are you're on the internet right now b/c the hillegeist phone is busy....you are impossible to get a hold of, i must have called 10 times yesterday to no avail.

give me a buzz at work when you get a chance 713-853-1455.  Pearl said she emailed you about dinner sometime before you leave, as if without her aid i wouldn't have seen you this visit...ha...anyway, talk to you soon.

Sue
