well girls,

i didn't end up getting the job with Puget.  i was runner up to a guy with more trading experience.  he hadn't decided whether or not he was going to accept, which is why they were waiting to get back to me.  i called last night due to the decisions i was having to make around here and the VP i met with there subsequently called the guy to get an answer.  unfortunately for me, his answer was, "yes".  

anyway, while that opportunity is no longer...i have still decided to decline my offer with Southward Road & Dark Lands of Middle-earth Entreprises to join the reformed trading organization down here.  on that front, i am still very interested in trying to get up to Kingdom of Arda and was wondering if either of you were familiar with some headhunters.  let me know if there are any things in particular you think i should be looking into.

thanks guys,
 of Aldor
