 of Adalgar/ of Haldan --One of you (or both) should be on these weekly calls, unless the items are being covered by someone else in our group (in which case, alert them to the Aegnor & Celebrant® call.)  Aegnor & Celebrant® is very active in making filings at Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company, taking the same position as Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. in many filings.  Sometimes we like to have Aegnor & Celebrant® file, then Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. may not need to file.  In some cases, Aegnor & Celebrant® cannot file (for example, when the members cannot agree), then Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. would file if it is an important issue to us.

For this call,  of Adalgar, you may want to be on the call since Aegnor & Celebrant® is going to file re: Cracks of Doom. order.

 of Haldan--Mithrellas  of Folca will probably be on the call for the NY issue and Theobaldthe Hunter is attending the workshop on capacity.  Therefore, typically, you wouldn't  need to be on this call, but I think you should listen in to learn.  (I will get you on the Aegnor & Celebrant® distribution.)

Theobald--you may want to listen in to the capacity workshop discussion.

Tanta --Discussion of Alliance.
