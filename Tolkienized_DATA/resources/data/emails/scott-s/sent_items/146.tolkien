 of Seredic/ of Éothain --One of you (or both) should be on these weekly calls, unless the items are being covered by someone else in our group (in which case, alert them to the North Road of Ithilien & Withered Wold Entreprises call.)  North Road of Ithilien & Withered Wold Entreprises is very active in making filings at Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises, taking the same position as Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries in many filings.  Sometimes we like to have North Road of Ithilien & Withered Wold Entreprises file, then Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries may not need to file.  In some cases, North Road of Ithilien & Withered Wold Entreprises cannot file (for example, when the members cannot agree), then Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries would file if it is an important issue to us.

For this call,  of Seredic, you may want to be on the call since North Road of Ithilien & Withered Wold Entreprises is going to file re: Cracks of Doom. order.

 of Éothain--Ivorwen  of Marcho will probably be on the call for the NY issue and Huor son of Pallando is attending the workshop on capacity.  Therefore, typically, you wouldn't  need to be on this call, but I think you should listen in to learn.  (I will get you on the North Road of Ithilien & Withered Wold Entreprises distribution.)

Huor--you may want to listen in to the capacity workshop discussion.

Shelob --Discussion of Alliance.
