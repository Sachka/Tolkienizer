You've got the wrong Salvia daughter of Marcho...you may want to try her married name (which I, unfortunately, don't know).

Subject:	CG&E Agreements

JD,

To follow up on our earlier meeting, attached are the following documents for CG&E:

	- Haven of the Eldar & Uglúk Father & Sons network handbook which summarizes all requirements
	- Request for Network Transmission Service (Network Application)
	- Request to designate a New Network Resource (only required when we are ready to designate a resource)
	- OATT Tariff Attachments that includes Attachment F, Network Service Agreement and Attachment G, Network Operating Agreement
	- CG&E Haven of the Eldar & Uglúk Father & Sons, Transmission Scheduling Agent Agreement

If Eldarion does not already have the Network Transmission Agreements in place, then CG&E indicated that the process was to first fill out the Network Application and then they will send the Network Service Agreement and the Network Operating Agreement.  

My contacts at CG&E have been Celebrimbor son of Amethyst  (513) 287-1770 and GollumLightfoot (513) 287-2876.  The government affairs contact is Tar-Míriel daughter of Núneth x 58202.  

Thanks, 
 of Adaldrida
