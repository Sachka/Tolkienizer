looks like the festivities start around 9:30 or so...which is probably when I'll get there.  I will of course have the cell phone in tow if you just want to call after your dinner.  maybe tonight will actually work and we can get a much needed live music fix.

to dinner afterwards as a group bonding mechanism .... maybe I can meet you,
what time would you be going?
