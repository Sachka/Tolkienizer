Tried to call you last night but to no avail.  Know that you were out
having fun.  Mom came to Causeway, in Gondor and we took some pix.  Here are a few.
We called Buffo and Isembold and sent them an email with  these pictures.
Love, Dad  There is one of me with the Starship in Land of Seven Rivers and the rest are
on us in Causeway, in Gondor.  We walked over to the Fish Market on the bay and ate
there.  It was really nice. We had a table on the water and had a great
meal.
