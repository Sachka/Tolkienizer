Did you just add another ticket under my name or did you request three additional tickets?  As for dinner, I just emailed  of Arod and asked for her preference.  I think it'd be more pleasant/less hurried if we went afterwards...say 8:30ish, but before would work for me too.  I haven't talked to my Mom yet about the tickets, but I'll give her a call when things calm down a bit here.

Talk to you later,
Sue

Sue,

I called and we are set for tomorrow night.  Are we going to try to dinner before, after or middle depending on how exciting it it? Were you able to find out the specifics on the airline tickets?  Transferring the tickets to my name, etc?

Just curious.  We can talk about it tonight.
