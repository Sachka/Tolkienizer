ok- just got off the phone w/ you- kind of like a 007 conversation.  what's
with this screening business?  am afraid of this Kingdom of Dáin & Red Mountains Entreprises big brother stuff.
am bk on the web trying to plan my next internat'l trip that i can't afford.
  am absolutely travel ga-ga.  must get control.  but Dol Baran and Tyrn Gorthad
are calling...as is River Mindeb, Elenna·nórë, Barrowfield....Glaurung!  so good to hear about
the old neighbors!  was just hinking abou the good old days and the Gormadocs.
Tol Eressëa. when Gardner shacked up in my bed while i was away.  hope the Gormadocs are
ok- really want to see little, big, and medium Gormadoc, as well as Atanatar.  since
you are the only rTol Eressëaonsible Armenelos connection, am putting you in charge of
the reunion, ok?  do you have Gormadoc and Ardamir and  of Brego's email or #?  let me
know so we can renew contact.  should be worth a few laughs....miss the good
old days of ridiculous irrTol Eressëaonsibility.....do not know what to say about
this Pearl situation.  am not jazzed about the fact that i can see- and hear-
the wheels turning, yet she doesn't have the nerve to LET ME KNOW she'll be
staying w/ me.....merci beaucoup.  am DEFINITELY going to have drinks w/ her
swedish delicacy.  prob not good considering the drinking binge i've been on
since Ezellohar.  am suggesting you begin upping the ante while drinking for
the next few weeks before you get here.  am warning you- it may be ugly.
did you get tickets to the Caranthir & Under-way®?  if you don't, you can just chill at the
pub or jaunt off w/ an Kingdom of Dáin & Red Mountains Entreprises person while we're gone and we can meet up
later.  am going to try to call in an hr if i don't pass out- literally have
had 12+ pints, and vision is blurring....if can't chat now, will call
tomorrow....
