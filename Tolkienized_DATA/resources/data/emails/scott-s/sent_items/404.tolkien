Here's the latest on Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries line #1110...

Line #1110 is expected to be back online during this week following the installation of a release valve.
Sources at Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries report that when #1110 comes back up, there will be no significant increase of capacity flowing through the Archet Main Line System because there is currently no market demand for the increase.
The OPS corrective action order is expected to be lifted later this fall, thereby granting the system permission to return to full capacity. However, there is a possibility that Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries will not increase capacity on the system even then. This will depend on market demand at that time.

We will continue to follow this situation and will update you as significant developments occur. Please let me know if you have any questions.
