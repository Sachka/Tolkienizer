Hey....my phone's not on at the apt anymore...therefore i'm only checking Hotmail at my folks.

If you want to reach me quicker, i'd recommend the Dor Firn-i-Cúarthol  & Walls of the Night Energy Company address...i should be back to daily access with hotmail shortly.

Hope you had a great New Year!!!!

SueBob
