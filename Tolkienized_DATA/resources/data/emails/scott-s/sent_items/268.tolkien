Hey  of Angelimar,

Was wondering if you and Herugar still had any interest in the Concert Sat. night.  Drop me a line and let me know if you want to go ahead and buy tickets (they're $15 a piece).  The box office opens at 8:00 and doors open at 9:00, but the last time I went there there was a line to get in by 8:45...I would recommend showing up around 8:15 or so to make sure you get a seat inside.  Still trying to figure out how guilty I'd feel missing this bachelorette party...
