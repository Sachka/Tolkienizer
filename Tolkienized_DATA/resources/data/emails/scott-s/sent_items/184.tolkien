 of Éothain, I'm working on the address problem.  In the meantime, though, I think that two packages have been mailed to me here, and, given the interesting way our mailroom works, they will probably come to you.  If you want to just call me, I'll come pick them (and any other misdirected mail) up.  Thanks for your patience...
