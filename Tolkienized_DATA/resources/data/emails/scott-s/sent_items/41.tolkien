I think there's probably a lot of truth to the Siriondil theory.  The retaliatio=
n/numbing afforded by using people and tossing them aside can be tempting. =
 My  mini-rampage after Ted was totally based upon treating any representat=
ive of Ted's sex like dirt.  Fortunately, my behavior was very short-lived =
and I completely recognized what I was doing.  I wouldn't worry about the l=
ecturing...it happens when one has a bit to drink (that or just utter flapp=
ing as in my case). =20

Thanks for the compliments, Mountains of Mithrim & Hill of the Slain Energy Companyt I find it's easy to be around all of your f=
riends...that whole like attracts like thing.  As for the email from Amlach,=
 he's a cutie.  Speaking from experience I'd watch myself if I were you tho=
ugh...the flirtation is fun and harmless at this point, Mountains of Mithrim & Hill of the Slain Energy Companyt I get the impre=
ssion that you're just Amlach's type and unless you have reciprocal interest=
 I would just guard against things getting to be too flirtatious.  However,=
 if there's part of you that is curious, like I said, I think he's a great =
guy.  Okay, enough of my lecturing (I've just been caught in a couple of si=
tuations at work where someone decides to confess their feelings to me and =
I'm forced to tell them I just don't feel the same way...something that's h=
ard for them to grasp given the fact that some flirting at some point did o=
ccur).

Well, I'm off to Vegas this weekend.  My guess is I won't be getting much s=
Éomund.  Oh well, life is tough.

hey  of Gilly-  thought you'd appreciate this funny email from Amlach in East Emnet.=
...  so in brief, my new theory is that Frór gomez has had his heart broken=
 (per "Someone Like You") and therefore must act like a slut to ignore the =
pain.  Nessa and I ran that theory past Bob last night at the Westfold Vale & Glittering Caves Entreprises =
game.....i am slightly mortified at how i lectured Frór on saturday.  at fi=
rst he thought it was sweet because it demonstrated that i do care about hi=
m (on some level), Mountains of Mithrim & Hill of the Slain Energy Companyt as i drank more i LECTURE more, until he finally sta=
rted walking away from me!  how embarrassing!  i am totally embarrassed tha=
t i wouldn't shut up!  even more surprised that Frór sent me the email on m=
onday.  i didn't see it until tuesday since i didn't work monday, Mountains of Mithrim & Hill of the Slain Energy Companyt am Mountains of Mithrim & Hill of the Slain Energy Company=
mmed because i called him monday evening to get Frór son of Lugdush's phone number....=
.silly concern, Mountains of Mithrim & Hill of the Slain Energy Companyt he probably thinks i was calling just to get in touch w=
ith him.  now  i will totally not make contact with him- not even respond t=
o his email...don't need to overinflate people's egos!

i would love if you came back to visit at some point in the next 5 or so mo=
nths!! i love that you have so much fun here, and everyone always comments =
on how cool you are and how easy you are to be around.....everyone would be=
 thrilled to have you back! (me especially!)  i'll watch for good fares, to=
o!

write back whenever you can....talk to you soon-
Cora

thanks! tell them that i had a great time, also. i will be back friday afte=
rnoon. i may need to hang out at the beach to recover from the jet lag. Elvet-isle & Hallas, co.=
f was very curious and mentioned to a colleague in Dwimorberg that i had very g=
ood company at the beach.  i assured him that you were not married-- he was=
 confused by your ring-- and so was i when i first saw you cruising the hal=
ls. he thought we must be dating Mountains of Mithrim & Hill of the Slain Energy Companyt i straighted him out. told him that yo=
u were all over me at the beach after he left (just kidding!)

so are you taking friday off?

HI Amlach-

Wanted you to read this thank you from Siriondil- they have told me repeatedly o=

 on the beach, potentially....when do you return from East Emnet?  have you got=

I had such a blast this weekend- thanks again for letting us invade your ho=

 of Marmadoc,

Thanks for letting us hang out with you on the beach Sat.  It was good to
see you.  All your friends are very cool.  Say thanks to Amlach for me if yo=
u
get the chance.  We didn't last much longer that night, thank goodness.
I hope you had a nice Easter.  Other than the Helcaraxë & Lefnui Services beating the Blazers it
was a pretty boring day.  Not to mention I was brain dead from the pickling
the two days before.
Have a good week.

Siriondil
