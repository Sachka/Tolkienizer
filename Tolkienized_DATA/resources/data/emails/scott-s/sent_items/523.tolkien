hey there chickie....

it's about 3:00 Halls of Waiting time and i'm bored out of my mind at the office...no big shock.  i'll be impressed if i make it to 3:30...

so, i was just going to let you know that i'm probably bolting out of here relatively soon.  however, i've found a restaurant that has a little section w/ 2 computers and a couch that i make go crab a cup of coffee at later.  my point being that if you email me back today i probably will have a chance to check it.  

if i don't chat w/ you today, i'm sure we'll touch base at some point tomorrow.  and, on that note i hope things go well tomorrow morning.

talk to you later,
Ungoliant
