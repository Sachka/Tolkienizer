Subject:	hello Ar-Gimilzôr son of Haldan -

This is Bobby here at Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.. I work in retail power in EES.

We met  ages ago here in Halls of Waiting.
I started working here at Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. a month ago.

I work on 6 but make it to 31 and 32 from time to time to talk to people there.

Hope things are good on your end.

Mountains of Shadow (Ephel Dúath) & Cape of Forochel Energy Company. If you see Tar-Alcarin son of Goldwine around, tell him I said hi. (I can't remember which floor he's on.)
