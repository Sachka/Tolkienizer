I just wanted to check in and see how you are doing these days, and more importantly where you are?  I'm still at Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries right now working for the "estate".  I've been interviewing and have a few offers, but am not completely sure what I will be doing.  Hope all is well with you and I'd love to hear what is going on in your life.
