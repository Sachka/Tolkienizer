Hey Ted,

Do I even know this guy, or has someone yet again confused me with the other Berylla daughter of Folca?  Since your one of the only names on this thing I recognize, besides Melian's, I thought I'd ask.

 of Haldan

Start crying because our  of Tar-Ciryatan Neslage is moving on to bigger and better opportunities.  Of course, he has to travel the globe for two months to recover from leaving us, but Friday, August 10, is our last opportunity - at least on a daily basis - to see his smiling face. His innate ability to make us laugh will be sorely missed!

So, in between the kleenex, hugs and kisses, we are going throw back a few drinks in his honor!   Please join us Friday, 6:00 p.m. for Happy Hour at Anardil's on 2111 Shepherd (between Vale of the Great River and Towers of Gondor; across the street from Karningul & Seven Rivers of Ossir, co.).

Bring friends - the more the merrier!
