Okay...I'm an idiot...I forgot to bring your email address with me to East Emnet (it's saved in my contacts list at work) and I can't check my work email from outside locations...augh!  Yet again, I fail.  However, I had such a good time visiting I think I'm going to try to make a quick trip back over this fall when the air fares are a little cheaper.  That way, I could see you and Gildis and Clay.  I will stick your phone number in my physical address book and be a better visitor next go-round.

Sorry again for the oversight.  Also, the next trip I make will most likely be solo (my roommate in Halls of Waiting came with me this time) so it will be significantly easier for me to maneuver.

Talk to you soon,
 of Haldan

Any luck on the roommate front?  Do you still want me to talk to Malva?
