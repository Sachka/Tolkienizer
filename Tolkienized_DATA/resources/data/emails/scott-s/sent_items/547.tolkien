Hi  of Tar-Ciryatan,

I've been trying to get a hold of  of Marmadoc this morning, but am not certain if she is in the office today.  My current situation has become somewhat interesting over the last several days and I was hoping to be able to talk over some things with her.  If  of Marmadoc is in fact out of the office today would you mind if we talked at some point.  I'm under some deadlines around here and would be very grateful to have an opportunity to discuss things with  of Marmadoc or yourself.

Thank you,
Berylla daughter of Folca
