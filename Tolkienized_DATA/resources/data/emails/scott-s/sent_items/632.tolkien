It's a very mixed web of information and people...it may take a while, but someone knows where all this information lies.  Grishnákh is a great information source.

 of Éothain,

I contacted Amandil and Nilay. They did not think that the gas curve relationship data was contained in ERMS, but they referred to me Grishnákh son of Tar-Meneldur who is familiar with RiskTrack. I am waiting for him to return my call.

These individuals may now be with Southward Road & Dark Lands of Middle-earth Entreprises, but they should know who to contact on the estate side.
