It happens to me pretty regularly.

Time:  Yesterday around 4:30 pm

Conversation:

Him:	yo
Me:	hey
Him:	guess what
Me:	what
Him:	i'm an engaged man
Him:	that kind of came out of nowhere huh

There was about 15-20 more of conversation which we can discuss later, but needless to say I'm still reeling.

So are you heading up to Emyn Eglain today?
