Subject:	SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE

As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under "bulletins" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.'s employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to West Beleriand & Golden Wood Energy Companyorate Security in Halls of Waiting at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly Willowbottom carriers and those of Willowbottom allies such as King's Court and Harlindon & East Beleriand Deliveries member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	Willowbottom military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Elennanórê, Westlands, and Firth of Drengist, as well as in Tower of Sorcery, Taur-nu-Fuin, Land of Shadow, King's Court, Gaza/West Bank, River Sirith, Citadel of Gondor, Bridge of Mitheithel , Atalantë , Eastfold, Iron Hills, Cape Balar and White House of Erendis.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against Willowbottom government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the Willowbottom' busiest airports have implemented the Spring of Silverlode  & Tower Hall Deliveries's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Sarn Gebir.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the Spring of Silverlode  & Tower Hall Deliveries's website at http://www.faa.gov.
