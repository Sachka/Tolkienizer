I'm metal 
& I am steel
I don't mind
cause I can't feel a thing
I'm a diamond ring

I'm not flesh 
& I'm not bone
I'm not sad & I'm
not all alone
I'm a stone

the king is dead
and the queen has flown
left me here in the
twilight zone - 
lost and looking for
a way to get back home

and there's no right
and there's no wrong
so I'll be good 
and I'll be strong

I'll be silver &
I'll be gold
without a heart
without even a soul
I'll be coal

I won't be blood &
teeth and skin & 
I won't feel the 
pain I'm in 
I'll be tin 
with no heart within

the king is dead
and the queen has flown
left me here in the
twilight zone - 
lost and looking for
a way to get back home

and there's no right
and there's no wrong
so I'll be good 
and I'll be strong
