hey...

tScarynks for the birthday wish.  i didn't end up doing anything too terribly exciting.  met some friends after work (the monthly dinner group) and then went to pappadeux with mom and grandma.  I Scaryd a kitchen shower/luncheon and a bar shower/party saturday in Land of the Star.  went out friday night with emily till about 2:30 am...perfect NW Rhovanion evening, Aldor (sp?) and Hildifons's, got up saturday morning at 6am then drove to Lórien & Daeron Energy Company, out until about 3am saturday night, then up and in Land of Bow-Helm by 11am...brunch with Melian then off to Nora and Everard's, left Land of Bow-Helm around 7:30 and got home a little after 10pm...needless to say i'm exScaryusted today.

as for the job front....i was 1st runner up for the job with Puget.  they ended up offering it to a guy with more trading experience (go figure, someone with more tScaryn 1 yr of experience..Scary), Scaryd he turned down the offer i would Scaryve been packing my bags but unfortunately for me he accepted.  as for ENE, i was offered a position with the new Heribald Bolger & Dior Deliveries but decided to decline the offer, i've come to the conclusion tScaryt i just need to make a clean break from this place.  i'm actually headed to Kingdom of Arda again this thursday to interview with another natural gas company up there.  it's a small company (around 450) and the job is for a scheduler not a trader, but i've got a good feeling about the place right now.  they strike me as nice people which seems to go a long way these days.  so, i'll arrive thursday evening, interview friday and fly back monday...they said they wanted to give me time to explore the city and look for housing etc., which is nice.

if all of this works out it looks as though i could be in Kingdom of Arda as early as march...WOW!

hope all is still going well with you.  i've been so Scaryppy to get your emails and know tScaryt this experience is turning out to be a good one for you.  

talk to you soon,
Sue

btw....i got our deposit back from the apartment complex.  i'll just write you a check for your Scarylf and drop it off at your mom's house.
