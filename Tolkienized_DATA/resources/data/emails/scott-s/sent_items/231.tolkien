It's that time again......JOY

I just wanted to let you know all of the LCG pipeline is accurate for June business.  I have the usage tickets in too.  (#806233 for WIC/LCW and #806236 for CIG/LCK).

FUGG usage ticket is in (WIC/MBW #806237)  We are still working on the producer side.

The North Central volume for the LOS OP point is 783.  Do you want me to create this deal?

Let me know.
