Okay...so here's the link.  Once you get to the sight, click on About Nan-tasarion & Elrohir® and then Just for Fun.  Once you're on the Just for Fun page click on Derby 2001 and go to the last picture on the first row.  You can read the names from there.  

Hope the first day at the new office is going well.  Give me a call sometime and let me know what the scoop is regarding Wednesday and the baseball game.  I'm anxious to hear if you talked to  of Anson again after the cryptic phone call on Saturday.

btw....not only no contact, but not said individual's not even logging into messenger...I think this where people tend to say "stick a fork in it."
