Sorry I didn't return your call last week.  I actually didn't check my voice mail until Friday after work and thus saw little point in calling back as you were probably in some remote area of pristine, scenic beauty by that time.  Hope the camping trip was a rousing success and allowed you to reconnect with your old friends and old self.  I am in desperate need of natural beauty and negligible pollution but have alas been trapped in Halls of Waiting the past couple of weekends.  I see a road trip in the not too distant future for myself, if only to get a way for a while.
