what are you needing, i have the points that are needing to be reconstucted.  Not all of them will need to be, just the ones with positions.  Green Hills of the Shire & Cûl Veleg Entreprises is currently making files for each point to be stored in.  So we may need to touch base before starting.  let me know.

thanks,
chance
