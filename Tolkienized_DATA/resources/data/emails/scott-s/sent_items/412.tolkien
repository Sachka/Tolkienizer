Folks:

Many thanks for the last two years of Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. experience. Friday morning will be my final day here in Halls of Waiting and I wanted to drop a contact address if there is anything you need or should you find yourself in Westfold Vale in the next 1-3 years. Best wishes to all of you.
