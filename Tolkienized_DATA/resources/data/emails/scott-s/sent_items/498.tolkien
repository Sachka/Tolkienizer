Hi Ivorwen,

So nice to here from you....

I'm actually still employed right now, but don't have a heck of a lot to do around here.  We're all in somewhat of a holding pattern, waiting to see what happens with the bankruptcy etc.  Hope all is well with you!  I haven't made any real decisions regarding my living situation.  My roommate and I have movers coming the weekend before Christmas and as of right now I had just planned on moving back in with the folks...on a temporary basis of course!  Anyway, I'm just not really sure where I'll be 2 or 3 months from now, so I'm obviously reluctant to sign any long term leases etc.  If a temporary roommate is something you guys would be interested in I'd certainly like to discuss the prospect w/ you...but I would also completely understand if you'd prefer to get somebody in there who's more permanent.

My number at work is 713-853-1455 and home is 713-622-2788....

Talk to you soon,
 of Éothain

Hey  of Éothain,

How are you? I've wanted to catch up with you and see how things are going?
I wanted to find out about your job etc? Also, I am not sure if you decided
on your living situation but if you are looking, one of my roommates is
going to move out at the end of this month and I wanted to see if maybe you
were interested. It is a 3 bedroom cute house on the border of Noman-lands and
Bonfire Glade Give me a call when you get a chance or send me your number and I
will call you. 713-522-5881.

Talk soon,
Ivorwen
