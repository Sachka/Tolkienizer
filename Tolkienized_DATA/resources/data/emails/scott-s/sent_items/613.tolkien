Hey,

The trip to Taur-Na-Neldor was good...Isembold and Borlad actually live in Barrows (which is about 45 mins NW of Taur-Na-Neldor).  We went out to dinner in Taur-Na-Neldor both Friday and Saturday night, and spent the day walking around downtown on Saturday.  Isembold drove me around the Army base and showed me a bit of the area where they live.  We also went to this Botanical Garden/Museum called Vinyamar...it's the estate of the Dark Gate & Blackroot Vale, co. fortune.  Anyway, it was fun and very relaxing.  They're house is really cute and their neighborhood requires at least a 1/3 an acre for each house...so there's lots of land.

I haven't made a decision about the Deeping-stream job yet, I actually have until the end of next week to give them my answer.  In the meantime I've been talking to some headhunters and checking out any other options that may be out there.  At this point there is really no telling where in the Willowbottom I'm ultimately going to end up...which I personally find kind of fun.

We got a total of $350 out of the $400 deposit back (not too bad).  I just deposited the check so all I need to do is drop off a check for $175 to your Mom...which I will do this weekend.

Hope things are still going well there!

Keep me posted,
Sue
