Hi  of Gróin,

Sorry to be a pest of late.  I was hoping you might have an opportunity to talk this morning.  There are some deadlines I am facing currently that make it that much more beneficial for me to talk to you sooner rather that later.  If you could let me know if there is a time before 10:00 PST that would be a good time to talk I would really appreciate it.

Thanks,
Salvia daughter of Marcho
