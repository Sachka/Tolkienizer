Argeleb son of Wilibald, 

The Green Hills of the Shire & Cûl Veleg Entreprises guys said that 1:30 would be fine.  I have also asked them to email Borlad and Elatan with their requests.  If it is alright with you, we will plan to meet at your desk at 1:30.  What is your location again?

Thanks,
 of Haldan

 of Haldan,

I am busy this morning.  Can we do this early this afternoon, say at 1:30?

Also can you please send an email to my supervisor Borlad son of Oromendil and our main business user Elatan Valinor to outline what the request is.

Thanks,

 of Wilibald
