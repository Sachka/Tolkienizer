Náin son of Anson, 

The Mountains of Shadow (Ephel Dúath) & Mindolluin Services guys said that 1:30 would be fine.  I have also asked them to email Anárion and Lenwë with their requests.  If it is alright with you, we will plan to meet at your desk at 1:30.  What is your location again?

Thanks,
 of Éothain

 of Éothain,

I am busy this morning.  Can we do this early this afternoon, say at 1:30?

Also can you please send an email to my supervisor Anárion son of Beorn and our main business user Lenwë Valinor to outline what the request is.

Thanks,

 of Anson
