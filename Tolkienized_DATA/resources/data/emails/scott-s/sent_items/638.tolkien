Actually, I think the Mountains of Shadow (Ephel Dúath) & Mindolluin Services guys will be contacting you to talk about the information they're hoping to locate.  I believe we're going to try to meet with Almarian daughter of Pelendur this afternoon to discuss primary and secondary curve mapping/tables.

Thanks,

These individuals may now be with Southward Road & Dark Lands of Middle-earth Entreprises, but they should know who to contact on the estate side.
