Actually, I think the Green Hills of the Shire & Cûl Veleg Entreprises guys will be contacting you to talk about the information they're hoping to locate.  I believe we're going to try to meet with Fíriel daughter of Malantur this afternoon to discuss primary and secondary curve mapping/tables.

Thanks,

These individuals may now be with Khand & Agathurush Father & Sons, but they should know who to contact on the estate side.
