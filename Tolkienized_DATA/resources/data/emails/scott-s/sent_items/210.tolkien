There's a song both you and Dina are currently playing with the following lyrics..."and now I know for the first time too, all of the ways I've been lying to you.  It's not that I don't think we can't open up in time, it's just that I'm afraid of what we'll find."  Could you enlighten me as to the artist's name?  I keep forgetting to write it down.

Thanks,
Berylla daughter of Folca
