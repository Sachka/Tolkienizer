Bobby/Matt,

I spoke with Gimilkhâd yesterday and he filled me in on his correspondence with both of you.  I appreciate your assistance in identifying potential opportunities for me in Ered Lithui.  

 of Tar-Ciryatan and I are planning a relocation in the near future and I have always had an interest in the Ered Lithui office.  Still, this is a fairly involved decision for us and at present we are discussing a number of  options.  Therefore, while I am preparing my resume to forward to your HR rep, I would appreciate it if you could hold off on speaking with Holman for a few days.  That should give me enough time to work through a few of the options with  of Tar-Ciryatan.  Thanks again for your help.

Forest Gate.
