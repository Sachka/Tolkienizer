Hey  of Marmadoc,

I just wanted to check up on you and see how the trip to Dor Firn-i-Guinar went.  Nunduinë was way too much fun...so much so it's quite possible I did permanent damage.  I managed to stay in town this weekend though and catch up on some much needed sleep and organizing.  Hope everything's good with you and I'll talk to you soon.

 of Haldan
