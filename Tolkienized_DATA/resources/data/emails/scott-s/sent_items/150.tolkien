Hey  of Gróin,

I just wanted to check up on you and see how the trip to Dor Firn-i-Guinar went.  Nunduinë was way too much fun...so much so it's quite possible I did permanent damage.  I managed to stay in town this weekend though and catch up on some much needed sleep and organizing.  Hope everything's good with you and I'll talk to you soon.
