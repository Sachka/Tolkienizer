Hey...if you'd like to try and get together Thursday or Friday let me know.  I think a group is actually getting together Friday night for Thrór son of Belen's birthday, but I'd be willing to skip it (or go if you'd like to see some people).  Anyway, just drop me a note when you get a chance...I could definitely use a good chat session.
