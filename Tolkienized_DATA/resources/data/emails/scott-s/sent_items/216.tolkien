Well...I would certainly be up for a little travel.  The following locations looked interesting to me.  

Ford of Bruinen, Firefoot, Region of Everlasting Cold, Far Downs, Dor Dínen or Tyrn Gorthad & Western Shore Energy Company in Mounds of Mundburg.  Withered Wold & Lindórië©, Hiril,  of Tar-Telperiën, or Knock in Redhorn Gate.  Wraith-road in River Langwell.  Blackroot Vale, Twilit Meres, Methed-en-glad, Great Willow, Mansion of the Khazâd & River Sernui© in Brithon.  And....Fréawine.  However, I'm going home tonight to look in my guide book at all of these places so I'll send you another revised email tomorrow.

Get back to me when you can and let me know if you have any strong opinions one way or the other.  Obviously, I'm pretty flexible.

Sue

prob Dwimorberg stansted....about 6 pounds each way (approx $15 RT flights) to
plavces like Limliht, Crossings of Erui, Old Ford, etc...am totally free to going or
staying, but if there's something you particularly wnat to see or do NOT in
Dwimorberg, i can get the stuff together now while it's cheap.  plus- may be
