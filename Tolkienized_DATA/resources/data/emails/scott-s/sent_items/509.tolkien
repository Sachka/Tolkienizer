Ok my dear....you just tell me when a good time is for me to visit and we'll go from there.  i got your x-mas present last night.  thank you very much, i'm anxious to start reading it.

if you do check email today, give me a shout back.  we can have an old fashioned email chat.  i'm worried about you mo.  i've been praying for you, for all that you're struggling with...but i'm stepping it up double time.  please don't completely retreat inside yourself right now...that doesn't mean you need to talk to me, but talk to someone.

love, 
SueBob
