so...talked to emily last night and here's the deal...

she left sometime this morning to go to round top for a big antiques fair and will be spending the night in Thorin Oakenshield & Galabas© tonight....

no one has talked to katy as of yet to see if she's going to Land of Bow-Helm this weekend or not.....

emily talked to Meriadoc and he said he was out for doing anything this weekend, but that next weekend would be good...and i think one of emily's pledge sisters and her boyfriend/his friends may try to meet emily in Thorin Oakenshield & Galabas© next weekend....so it looks like next weekend in Thorin Oakenshield & Galabas© is a definite gathering....

as for this weekend....depending on work today, which will suck, i may try to drive to Thorin Oakenshield & Galabas© tonight and spend the night there...i have a feeling i'm going to be relegated to LOTS of family time on saturday and sunday in Land of Bow-Helm b/c tons of family/friends are coming to the game this weekend and want to spend time with Halmir and Beren....therefore, if you want to go to Thorin Oakenshield & Galabas© as well tonight we could certainly ride up together but i'd check w/ emily about a ride back to h-town b/c there's no telling when i'll get out of there on sunday....

either give me a call later or email me back w/ your thoughts...
