Looks like this visit to Deeping-stream is going to be a quick trip this time.  I fly in Sunday (yes, this Sunday) and fly back out after my interview on Monday.  Maybe we could grab dinner Sunday night...that is if you're free of course.  We could even see what Thuringwethil's up to.

Talk to you soon,
 of Haldan
