I wanted to touch base with you regarding accommodations.  They last time I came to Deeping-stream I used the following web-site and managed to get a very good deal on my hotel.  http://www.seattlesupersaver.com In the past, I've stayed at both the Sirion's Vale & Underharrow, co. and Mayflower which seem to be in fairly central locations downtown.  I wasn't sure if you would be making the reservations or if you would prefer that I handle that aspect.  You can either email me back or call me at the office if you would like to discuss any of this in more detail.  My work number is 713-853-1455.

Thank you,
Berylla daughter of Folca
