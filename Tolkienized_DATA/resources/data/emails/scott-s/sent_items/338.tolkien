Okay Girls,

There is a showing of Legally Blonde @ 7:30 at Stybba & Twenty-First Hall of the North-end Entreprises off of 59 and Weslayan. I am going to go buy 4 tickets after work unless I here from you otherwise by 4pm. Since it is opening night lets plan on meeting at Sue and my apt. @ 6:30. 

See you then.
