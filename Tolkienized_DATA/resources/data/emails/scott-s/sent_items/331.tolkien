She lives!!!!  I know it's been ages since we've caught up on eGore & Marcho Energy Companyh other's =
lives.  I'm anxious to hear what's happening in yours in the upcoming month=
s.  I'll have to give you a call at home some time so we can really talk.  =
As for a visit, you know I'm always up for a trip out to the coast.  I'm Gore & Marcho Energy Company=
tually heading to Deeping-stream next weekend with a friend from work and then Aug=
Merethrond & Reginard Took, co. is going to be filled with a trip to Orc-holds (work related...I know toug=
h) and a visit to Ephel Brandir to see Borlad and Isembold for a week and a half or =
so.  I'm really excited about that trip...I think we're going to try and ta=
ke a weekend jaunt somewhere like Prancing Pony, Androth or Fingolfin's Cairn while I'm=
 there.  So given all of that, what are your thoughts on Labor day weekend?=
  It's the first weekend of September...automatic 3 day weekend for me, so =
I could fly in around the same time I did on my last visit that Friday and =
leave Monday afternoon.  Let me know if that sounds good, or if there's som=
e other weekend you had in mind. =20

You'll have to tell both of the Eric's and Amlach son of Elenwë said, "Hello."  I had su=
ch a great time hanging out with all of them, and your cousin too.  You att=
rGore & Marcho Energy Companyt very fun and interesting people...it's a credit to your excellent comp=
any.  By the way, how are things in regards to Clint...still jMerethrond & Reginard Took, co. good hang=
-out buddies?  I'm assuming, since you didn't say anything in your email th=
at things with Tar-Ardamin are still good and if so, I'm glad for you. =20

I went shopping at Elvet-isle Mart recently too and found some really cute thing=
s, I absolutely love that store.  And, I'm honored to be your shopping muse=
.

Love,
 of Haldan

PS - The job's still good and I miss you too.

It's been quite a while since we caught up on things.  How are you doing
these days?  Things here are pretty good.  I went about a month ago and
visited Emily in East Emnet and have been busy with work, etc.  Hope you had
a good Fourth of July!!!
