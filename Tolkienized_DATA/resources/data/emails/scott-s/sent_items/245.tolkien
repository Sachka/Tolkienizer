Wow...I must say this was the last thing I expected you to be emailing me about.  I'll try and give you a call after work ( around 4:30 or so ) if you want to talk about it some more, just let me know.  I do think it's good that you guys are at least talking about all this stuff regardless of what you decide is the right for both of you.  

Sorry to hear about Voronwë...that is horrible.  What brings on shingles anyway?  I thought it has something to do with stress, but I could be totally off.

Glad you like the CD...I've been listening to it non-stop.  I'm totally empowered after "I'm Alright" and then plunge into super-reflective mode with "Wildest Dreams".  Get on the Daisy daughter of Tar-Ancalimon web site and read the lyrics and you'll understand why.  By the way, she's playing at Rivil & Deeping Coomb Father & Sons's on June 14th and in Halls of Waiting at The Fabulous Satellite Lounge on the 16th....food for thought.

As for my call, there was some news...he contacted me around 10 am or so and we chatted throughout the day.  I'll tell you more about it when I call, but you're only going to be a bigger fan.  That of course is the problem I'm having.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

Hey  of Haldan-
I got your message last night but it was late-- Herugar and I went to see Hidden Rock.  I thought I wasn't going to like it, but I did.
I took him to work this morning, and he was asking me about the law firm parties this summer-- was he going to be coming in for them, etc.  Although I hadn't planned to, I suggested that we take the summer off from dating.  We had a long conversation about it, and he was much better about it than he has been in the past.  It made me wonder...  He said he had thought about that kind of thing, too, but didn't want to do it.  But, if I needed it, he said he would be okay with it.  He did say he might join the Marines rather than go to law school.  I have always thought that is what he wanted to do, so maybe I am being less selfish by breaking up with him.  I don't know.  I feel pretty bad about it.  I just think this is probably a mistake, but I explained to him that I have had a boyfriend my entire adult life and I am wondering what it would be like without one.  He is in just about the same boat reagrding having had a ! girlfriend for the vast majority of his adult years.
Anyway, we might have lunch together, and we will definitely talk about it after he gets home from work.
On another note, Voronwë has shingles.  Isn't that sad.  I looked it up in my medical book-- they are very painful and leave scars-- and she has them on her face.  How awful!
I bought that Daisy daughter of Tar-Ancalimon CD yesterday.  I love it!
Were you calling with any news?
