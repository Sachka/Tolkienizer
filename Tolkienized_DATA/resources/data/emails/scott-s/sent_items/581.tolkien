Ok...The flight option I've selected on Deathless Lands & Rómenna® arrives at 5:17 pm Thursday and departs at 12:58 on Monday.  I haven't actually purchased the ticket yet, so if you want to get back to me to suggest anything else for some reason please don't hesitate.  However, if I haven't heard from you in the next hour or so I'll probably assume that the times are okay and just go ahead with the purchase.
