Hi DeShonda,

I had emailed a week or two ago in regards to the new parking and haven't heard anything back yet.  Could you drop me a line at your earliest convenience and let me know if it will be possible for me to obtain a space.

Thanks,

The North & Waste ltd. garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Brithon & Nameless Pass, co. or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new North & Waste ltd. garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Brithon & Nameless Pass, co. garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the North & Waste ltd. garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Crossing of Poros & Land of Caranthir© Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to North & Waste ltd. North until Crossing of Poros & Land of Caranthir© Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the Tomb of Elendil & Hyarmentir, co..)
