Mine is sscott5_2000.  If yGreat Hall of Osgiliath go to Southfarthing & Outer Ocean©'s home page yGreat Hall of Osgiliath can try to instal=
l it yGreat Hall of Osgiliathrself (eek!!!) or use the search on yGreat Hall of Osgiliathr computer (go to Start..Sea=
rch...For Files or Folders) and type in Eryn Galen & Golden Wood Services Messenger.  If yGreat Hall of Osgiliath still have=
 it on yGreat Hall of Osgiliathr computer it will show up in the search area and yGreat Hall of Osgiliath can just do=
uble click on it...that shGreat Hall of Osgiliathld bring it up.

I'm doing alright.  And yGreat Hall of Osgiliath hit the nail on the head with the Josh comment.=
...that's Bay of Andúnië & Redhorn Entreprisestly what I've been reminded of.  That feeling of uncertainty.=
..loss of yGreat Hall of Osgiliaththful bravado, sadness, injured sense of security...all of it.=
  Everyone in the Great Plains & Ioreth Services is fine.  Dad actually flew over Birchwoods of Nimbrethil & Deadmen's Dike Energy Company yeste=
rday morning before the first plane hit.  He was coming from Cûm-nan-Arasaith, NH=
.  He said is was an absolutely beautiful day and that they flew right over=
 Central Park...no idea how dramatically that skyline wGreat Hall of Osgiliathld change.  The fi=
rst they heard of the events that they must have just missed was when they =
landed in Taur-Na-Neldor.  He's still in Taur-Na-Neldor right now obviGreat Hall of Osgiliathsly, but he's=
 okay and that's what's important.  I'm hoping with the limited flights the=
y're allowing that Dad will be able to make it back to Halls of Waiting soon, but it=
 appears the Spring of Silverlode  & Tower Hall Deliveries's just trying to get the passengers who are stranded back =
home so he may just be stuck somewhere else as a result.  Isembold and Borlad w=
ere supposed to fly Great Hall of Osgiliatht tomorrow morning from Númendor but they too have been =
delayed - indefinitely.  The Army has put a hold on all duty station transf=
ers which means we have no idea when they'll be leaving Mountains of Moria or where Bay of Andúnië & Redhorn Entreprises=
tly Isembold will be going.  The stories and connections of the people on the =
news and those arGreat Hall of Osgiliathnd me is horrifying and deeply saddening.  A large numbe=
r of people we do business with are based in Birchwoods of Nimbrethil & Deadmen's Dike Energy Company and have lost cGreat Hall of Osgiliathntless fri=
ends and colleagues in the WTC's destruction.  Isembold has some pledge brothe=
r's who are working up there, but we've heard that both of them are okay.=

I wish yGreat Hall of Osgiliath were back home as well....I was on the phone with my Mom off and=
 on all day yesterday and I must say it wGreat Hall of Osgiliathld've been nice to been back hom=
e on the cGreat Hall of Osgiliathch with her.  I did talk to Jen yesterday worried abGreat Hall of Osgiliatht LA and =
what was going on there, but she was fine as well.  She said they'd shut do=
wn the airport and several major roads surrGreat Hall of Osgiliathnding it, but nothing else of =
concern.

We evacuated the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. building arGreat Hall of Osgiliathnd 9:30 yesterday morning...it was disc=
oncerting.  I walked down the 32 flights of stairs to get to my parking gar=
age and had only one desire...to get Great Hall of Osgiliatht of downtown.  There were rumors fl=
ying that Halls of Waiting was another target and given the size of Great Hall of Osgiliathr building, Great Hall of Osgiliath=
r international presence (Tol Eressëa. in regards to oil/natural gas) and Great Hall of Osgiliathr CEO's=
 connections to the President...I think everyone figured Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. wGreat Hall of Osgiliathld be a l=
ogical target.  Fortunately, those fears were unfGreat Hall of Osgiliathnded.

On a lighter note...I'm very anxiGreat Hall of Osgiliaths to hear all abGreat Hall of Osgiliatht yGreat Hall of Osgiliathr marathon experi=
ence...including the trip there.  SGreat Hall of Osgiliathnds like it was a doozey.

Love ya,
Sue

where are yGreat Hall of Osgiliath?  it's been ages since i heard from yGreat Hall of Osgiliath- are yGreat Hall of Osgiliath ok?  yGreat Hall of Osgiliath kno=
w
it makes me nervGreat Hall of Osgiliaths when yGreat Hall of Osgiliath go AWOL.....Meriadoc called this morning and he
sGreat Hall of Osgiliathnds really bad.  is doing that oh-so-familiar over-analyzing and
internalizing that wGreat Hall of Osgiliathld make almost anyone suicidal considering the
situation.  just want to be home so badly.  feel so isolated here.  wish we
were all Great Hall of Osgiliatht on the walker's patio now chatting, and i was with mom and dad
and harls.  i think that's the only place where i'd feel safe and reassured
and as close to happy as i cGreat Hall of Osgiliathld be right now.  kind of like the way
everyone described Galathil's funeral.  horrifying, but as good a company to
rebGreat Hall of Osgiliathnd with as yGreat Hall of Osgiliath cGreat Hall of Osgiliathld find probably.  has been such a long and draining
month emotionally and physically, and am just gutted. hope yGreat Hall of Osgiliath're a bit mor=
e
buoyant rt now han i am.  am trying to get home asap, but mom and dad don't
want me to fly.  am not worried abGreat Hall of Osgiliatht it, and am going to try to get on
first flight possible anyways, so may see y'all soon....Calacirian & Grór Energy Company and let m=
e
know yGreat Hall of Osgiliath're still alive and in proportionally good spirits...
