Hi Anárion,

I just wanted to follow up with you and see if you had a chance to look over my resume.  I realize I may not be exactly the candidate you had in mind when you first spoke with Gwindor, but I would very much appreciate the opportunity to speak with you and discuss any opportunities you may have available at this point.  As Gwindor can attest to, I've had responsibilities at Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries that span from back office to trading.  To that extent, I believe I could prove to be a valuable asset within any organization.

Thank you,
Salvia daughter of Marcho
