Hi Isilmo son of Hilda,

Sorry it's taken me so long to respond regarding the party Saturday ( of Holman and I only got back into town a couple days ago from visiting Emily in East Emnet).  I had actually already purchased concert tickets for Saturday night, but am currently seeing if I can find anyone willing to buy them from me.  If I am successful in pawning these things off I will be present and accounted for to help  of Algund and the gang celebrate.  I will be sure to take your number home with me and give you a call tomorrow to let you know my status either way.

Thanks again for everything,
 of Haldan
