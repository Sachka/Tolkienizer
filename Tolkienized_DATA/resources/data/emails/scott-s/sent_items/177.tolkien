Okay, you asked for it....

The mind I love must have wild places, a tangled orchard where dark
                                  damsons drop in the heavy grass, an overgrown little wood, the chance of a
                                  snake or two, a pool that nobody's fathomed the depth of, and paths
                                  threaded with flowers planted by the mind.

I absolutely love this quote.  It manages to state, significantly more eloquently than myself, my own personal mantra of the last few years...I want to be pleasantly surprised.  Which is ultimately why I don't see it within my power in the near future to settle.  Maybe years down the road when desperation has set in I'll break down and throw myself at some sub-par individual, but let's hope it never gets to that point or if it does that I'm bordering on senile and just don't know any better.  

Anyway, I'm so glad we got to spend so much time together at Lavender's wedding and I love hanging out with you Mom and Ciryatur (sp?)...they crack me up.  If there's anything I can do to assist you with this wedding, let me know...even if you just need someone to run errands with or support your ideas.  I'd love to get together sometime this week for a drink, coffee, dinner, or whatever if you have any free time.  Maybe  of Niënor would be available as well?

Talk to you soon,
Sue
