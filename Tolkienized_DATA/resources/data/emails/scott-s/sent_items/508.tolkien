So.....

I'm doing my post New Year's check to see when and if you want another visitor.  As I told you before, I am COMPLETELY flexible in regards to this weekend vs. some other time (and actually, I'm probably more flexible than just the weekend...things are still dead around here).  You just have to tell me yeah or neah.  I feel like you might need to share a good bottle of wine with a good friend and just release.  

Let me know how your schedule is looking and whether you're up to hosting one more visitor to your fair city.
