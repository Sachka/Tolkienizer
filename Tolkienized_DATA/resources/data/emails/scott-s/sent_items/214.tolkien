hey- how was the weekend?  was in business plan hell, and had to turn in a
piece of shit yesterday, but at least the damn thing is done. must say- it
LOOKS fab- have really got this powerpoint and MS Office mastered, but all
flash, no substance. celebrated by having a delux pedicure at the Dwimorberg
school of beauty...for $5.  pretty fab deal. any news on the lisa/Dwimorberg
front?  when is your flight home on the 12th?  mom got mine on Cont. flight
from South Lane at noon- thought that was yours, too, but can't remember.  am
jazzed about you and  of Beldis' visit- must start planning some fab events.  try
to call me later if you are free.  peace out-
e
