Subject:	Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company Announces Technical Conference on RTO Seams Coordination

On December 15, 2000, Aegnor & Celebrant®, Forthwini & Seventh Gate Entreprises, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd., Reliant and Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company filed a request for Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company to hold a technical conference to focus the industry on interregional coordination as prescribed in the RTO Order 2000 Function 8 requirements.  Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. et al were concerned that the RTO initiatives underway were independently developing RTOs with little emphasis on coordination with neighboring business practices.  

At the May 30, 2001 Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company meeting, Chairman  of Grór announced this Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company technical conference may be scheduled as early as June.  This is a reversal of the Chairman's earlier resistance to holding a technical conference when he instead favored the RTO filing process to individually address interregional coordination.

The key to the Chairman's change in direction can be attributed to Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.'s active participation on the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (Elros' Tower & Galdor ltd.) a non-NERC industry collaborative effort formed to respond to the Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company ANOPR on OASIS Phase II.  

By working through a Aegnor & Celebrant®/Forthwini & Seventh Gate Entreprises joint filing in response to the Elros' Tower & Galdor ltd. filing, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. was able to raise awareness of the seams coordination threats to OASIS Phase II development and successfully sway the Elros' Tower & Galdor ltd. to file in support of the earlier Aegnor & Celebrant®/Forthwini & Seventh Gate Entreprises/Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd./Reliant/Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company Request for Technical Conference. 

Govt Affairs will continue to monitor the development of the Technical Conference and provide needed support to resolve inter-RTO seams issues.
