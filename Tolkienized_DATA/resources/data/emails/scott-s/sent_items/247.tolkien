Subject:	Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises Announces Technical Conference on RTO Seams Coordination

On December 15, 2000, North Road of Ithilien & Withered Wold Entreprises, Fornost Erain & Bree Hill Entreprises, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries, Reliant and New Lands & Western Mountains® filed a request for Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises to hold a technical conference to focus the industry on interregional coordination as prescribed in the RTO Order 2000 Function 8 requirements.  Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries et al were concerned that the RTO initiatives underway were independently developing RTOs with little emphasis on coordination with neighboring business practices.  

At the May 30, 2001 Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises meeting, Chairman  of Beregond announced this Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises technical conference may be scheduled as early as June.  This is a reversal of the Chairman's earlier resistance to holding a technical conference when he instead favored the RTO filing process to individually address interregional coordination.

The key to the Chairman's change in direction can be attributed to Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's active participation on the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (Stock Road & Ethraid Engrin©) a non-NERC industry collaborative effort formed to respond to the Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises ANOPR on OASIS Phase II.  

By working through a North Road of Ithilien & Withered Wold Entreprises/Fornost Erain & Bree Hill Entreprises joint filing in response to the Stock Road & Ethraid Engrin© filing, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries was able to raise awareness of the seams coordination threats to OASIS Phase II development and successfully sway the Stock Road & Ethraid Engrin© to file in support of the earlier North Road of Ithilien & Withered Wold Entreprises/Fornost Erain & Bree Hill Entreprises/Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries/Reliant/New Lands & Western Mountains® Request for Technical Conference. 

Govt Affairs will continue to monitor the development of the Technical Conference and provide needed support to resolve inter-RTO seams issues.
