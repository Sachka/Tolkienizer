 of Niënor, I dont have a lot of time, but I'm glad you emailed me, I was planning 
on call you soon to talk to you about this.  You CANNOT go to Land of Willows.  I'm 
being completely serious.  You know how in favor I was of your trip, but in 
light of recent events and the responses that they will soon yield, you must 
cancel your plans.  I'm being very serious, it will not be safe for you to 
be there at all.  I really hope you take my advice.  Believe me--I know 
about these things.  We'll talk soon.
