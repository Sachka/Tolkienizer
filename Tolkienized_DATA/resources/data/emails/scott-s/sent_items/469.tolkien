that's amazing....i hit his door at least 10 times w/  of Carc's toy....i'm guessing he'd had a few cocktails too....

btw...shame on your for trying to get me to go in there as a joke....i almost did, until i remembered i'm not in college anymore and this guy works at my company...course that all came to me in a flash as i was turning the door knob.

you were doing a little nodding off yourself....that couch was a trap
