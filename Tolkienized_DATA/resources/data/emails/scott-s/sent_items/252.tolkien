I've never run that file since it was split out, but my guess is you need to add any prior month adjustments and broker fees to today's file.  Tomorrow you will want to roll the file over to the new month...Hayward should be able to help you with that.  Make sure you also follow the Liquidation instructions for the gas daily Balbo Baggins & Gardens of Lórien Entreprises's...you can find them on that color coded sheet  of Rían has.

Swing by if you need anything else.

 of Éothain,

Do you think you could stop by  of Rían's desk this afternoon when you
have a free moment. We need a little help as it is end of month!

Thanks,
