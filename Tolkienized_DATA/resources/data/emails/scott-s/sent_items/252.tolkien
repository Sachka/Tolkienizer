I've never run that file since it was split out, but my guess is you need to add any prior month adjustments and broker fees to today's file.  Tomorrow you will want to roll the file over to the new month...Peregrin should be able to help you with that.  Make sure you also follow the Liquidation instructions for the gas daily Yellow Mountains & Anghabar ltd.'s...you can find them on that color coded sheet  of Hirgon has.

Swing by if you need anything else.

 of Haldan,

Do you think you could stop by  of Hirgon's desk this afternoon when you
have a free moment. We need a little help as it is end of month!

Thanks,
