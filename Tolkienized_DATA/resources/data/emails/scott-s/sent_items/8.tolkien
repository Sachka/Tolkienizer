Just heard from the Adalgar...he said he's okay but has just been really busy the last few weeks.  I encourage you to drop him another line sometime in the near future and suggest lunch, as he seems receptive to interaction at this point.  

As for last Wednesday, we had actually moved on to Steak Night by 9:30 and then were off to East Beleriand & Mansion of the Khazâd ltd.'s.  Needless to say it was a big night.  

Glad to hear the game was good and I'm not suprised in the least that you have "get-up-and-go" (I've seen you when an attractive woman passes by).

I'm a no go for Thursday as I've actually already made dinner plans with a friend.  Besides,  of Wilcome's is the Entwash Vale & Anghabar ltd.'s favorite Thursday night hang-out for the reason you mentioned and for that same reason it sadly is not mine.  I'm sure after this response Sigismond will be convinced I'm avoiding him, but I assure you that is not the case.

Cheers

I should be in town this weekend if anything is going on...

Oh I am so glad to hear from you! How are things? Been thinking about you---no not in that way. :)
No, actually, Bregolas and I got back around 9:30 and I went into Farrago's to see if you were there....but you weren't. I looked like death warmed over after the game...it has been way too long since my playing days. To be true, I have the get-up-and-go, but I literally whiffed a few kicks...
Thankfully, Bregolas played well. He had one pitch that was sweet!!
What are you up to this week? I am trying to get Sigismond to go with me to  of Wilcome's on Thursday. I love that place on Thursdays....wait, I digress...I like the ladies on Thursdays there. Want to go?
Let me know what the Adalgar says...I am a little disappointed in him as of late...not that he cares.....

What happened to you last Wednesday?  Were you too pooped after you soccer game for a cold brew?  Hope you had a good weekend anyway and that things are in general are going well. 

 I just dropped the Adalgar a line to see if he's still breathing.  I'll let you know if I hear anything back.
