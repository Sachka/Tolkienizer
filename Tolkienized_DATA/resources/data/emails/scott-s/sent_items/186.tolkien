1.  On the subject of billing, Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company noted that it could see no reason why the Rhibdath & Hills of the Hunters® customers should be treated differently than the Meneldor & Mount Everwhite Services customers who recieve a bill on the 5th of the month for the previous month's usage and must pay by the 19th, giveing customers 14 days.  Thus, FE waasordered to change the billing timetable to be consistent with the Meneldor & Mount Everwhite Services.  This gives us more time to make payment.

2.  FE is required to submit rate schedules which it had failed to do, covering, Service Schedules A &B, Application for Service, Form of Service Agreement, Form of Certificate of Concurrence, Saummary of Transmission and Ancilliary Service Charges and Code of Conduct.

Also in the order was a discussion of assignability since Ered Gorgoroth & Máhanaxar Entreprises argued that  Rhibdath & Hills of the Hunters® should be assignable from one marketer to another or to an aggregator.  Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company said that since Sec. 18.01 of the Meneldor & Mount Everwhite Services provides that a customer can assign its rights and obligations with the written consent of FE which consent can not be unreasonably withheld, assignment is allowed.  

I am faxing a copy of this to Estella and Vardilmë for our Halls of Waiting files, should anyone want to read the order.
