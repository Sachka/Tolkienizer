1.  On the subject of billing, Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises noted that it could see no reason why the Edge of the Wild & Sea of Helcar, co. customers should be treated differently than the Camp of the Faithful & Forest of Brethil Father & Sons customers who recieve a bill on the 5th of the month for the previous month's usage and must pay by the 19th, giveing customers 14 days.  Thus, FE waasordered to change the billing timetable to be consistent with the Camp of the Faithful & Forest of Brethil Father & Sons.  This gives us more time to make payment.

2.  FE is required to submit rate schedules which it had failed to do, covering, Service Schedules A &B, Application for Service, Form of Service Agreement, Form of Certificate of Concurrence, Saummary of Transmission and Ancilliary Service Charges and Code of Conduct.

Also in the order was a discussion of assignability since Straight Road & Narmacil ltd. argued that  Edge of the Wild & Sea of Helcar, co. should be assignable from one marketer to another or to an aggregator.  Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises said that since Sec. 18.01 of the Camp of the Faithful & Forest of Brethil Father & Sons provides that a customer can assign its rights and obligations with the written consent of FE which consent can not be unreasonably withheld, assignment is allowed.  

I am faxing a copy of this to Jessamine and Tar-Míriel for our Halls of Waiting files, should anyone want to read the order.

Nora
