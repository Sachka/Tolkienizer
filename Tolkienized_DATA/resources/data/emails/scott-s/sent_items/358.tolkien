I know I've thoroughly enjoyed all the commentary.  I can honestly say, I think this is the first time I've been invited to an Aggie happy hour....and to that end, kudos to all those who opted out of Brego's Boat...you now may be forced to deal with a longhorn interloper.

By looking at the clock, it would appear the Mo beat Trip to the punch by 1 minute.  Accompany that with the fact that we have not gone to Baldor's as a group, and just recently went to the Front Porch, and haven't been to Bifur's in a long time and it's crappy outside.  Therefore I have to give the nod to...
 
the  of Lagdufcamp, barring a major uproar from the Friend camp.
 
What say ye?
