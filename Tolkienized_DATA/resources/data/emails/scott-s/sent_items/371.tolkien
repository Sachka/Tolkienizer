I just got a call from  of Éothain Ginsberg at Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries.  It seems they have heard from Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises staff that Aravir is showing up an awful lot to talk about the marketing affiliate rule and why there should not be any changes, but they wonder why, if they really are separate companies, the affiliates have not been in to talk to Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises themselves.  I think we have already heard this message, but Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries wants to set up a group to go into Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises.  THey are setting up a conference call for next Thur with some other companies to discuss this issue.  I told them we would be in on the call (we don't have to, tho) but that we may not want to go into Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises with that group.  

Would anyone like to be on the call next week, or have any problem with my participation in the call?  Shall we talk about going to Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises to give them our position?  (or should we just tell them to read our comments)
