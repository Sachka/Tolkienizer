i'll stop by while making my rounds this afternoon.  and, you'll have to get someone else to tell the stories...i don't remember much of friday night and, as a result, Brown had a "come to Jesus" meeting with herself this weekend.  may be the last of the truly good stories involving me for a while.

Of course I'd like you to swing by, I like talking with you ... I hear you have some stories from Friday you need to tell anyway.

If you pull the Curves up under Pub Names you should be able to tell if the have any Omicrons attached to them on the Erms side...if the do, then you have to talk to EdrahilHeathertoes to make sure they are mapped on the Germs side...if they don't, then you'll have to attach an omicron and then speak with Nilay.  I can swing by later if you'd like me to explain in a little more detail.

How do I find out the omicron curves for these curves?  Would Ulfast son of Ufthak?

Please see below and note that the following curves do not have any omicron vol curves.  Can you help map these?

Thanks,
