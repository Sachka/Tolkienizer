I just left a message for you at work...How EXCITING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't believe both you and Míriel got engaged on the same weekend.  I'm absolutely thrilled for you and look forward to all the fun festivities this will warrant.  You know I think Lightfoot is great (I've had so much fun hanging out with him at all of these weddings) and you're obviously pretty fond of him so I can't imagine a better bit of news than that of your engagement.  I can't wait to hear all about the event (and see the ring - I'm sure it's gorgeous).

I think I'm actually going to try and come up to Emyn Eglain the weekend of the 12th...from what I understand Gildis will still be in town, as will  of Angelimar, and Míriel had expressed some interest in making a road trip so we'll see.

Love,
Sue

PS - Are you coming in for Belba's wedding?
