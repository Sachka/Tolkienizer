I'm so sorry I've hurt you Maeglin...never my intention.  I had no idea you were so fragile, you hide it well.  Life at Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries is good but things have been pretty busy the last couple weeks.  I went to Armenelos last Friday to visit one of  of Niënor and my friends (actually it's the girl we visited in East Emnet) and then had a wedding to go to Saturday night.  

No big plans for the 4th as of yet.  I'm still trying to figure out where I'm going to be...could be Halls of Waiting, Emyn Eglain or Old World.  I know, I know...I'm such a jet-setter.  How about yourself?  Planning another famous Maeglin BBQ.  Cooking commences at 3:00 am, right?  

Hope you're having a nice day.
