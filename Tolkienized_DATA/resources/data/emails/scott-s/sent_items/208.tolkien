that sounds good...don't push yourself to do too much, you need to take it as easy as you can until all of your internships start this summer because you know they're going to be tiring.  plus, you'll be busy introducing me to all of the cute single guys you'll be working with...talk about exhausting!  i'll either chat with you tonight or tomorrow and we can figure out what, if anything, we want to do.  personally, just going a having a good meal coupled with good conversation sounds great to me - nothing big.

Probably tomorrow morning.  My brother couldn't come in, but I foresee a
long day here, so I don't know if I would be able to get out until too late
to drive home.

If anything changes, I will let you know.  Otherwise, I'll see you tomorrow.
