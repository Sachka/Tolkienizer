NáinGoodenough,

Just wanted to introduce myself and let you know that I received my offer information from Belen son of Ferdinand.  Since we didn't have a chance to meet and talk when I was in Overbourn Marshes last week, I was hoping at some point we might be able to discuss the responsibilities you envision for me within your group.    Please let me know when would be a good time for us to speak.

Thanks,
Salvia daughter of Marcho
