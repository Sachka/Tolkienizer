We know about Merle...don't know if I'll be able to go though b/c I have to be in Falls of Irvin at a bridal luncheon by 12:30 on Friday.  There's no reserved seating anyway so I think I might be a bit of a mess (remember how crowded the Light-tower & Ephel Brandir Deliveries were?)

As for the trip over...I'm arriving on the 6th ( Wednesday morning at 7:45) and I'll be leaving the morning of the 12th.  Not perfect, but if something looks appealing on the mid-week trip front let me know.  I'll have a total of 6 full days over there.  Plenty of time to do something interesting right?

Sue

I'm not going to tell  of Niënor for a little while, so mum's the word....hopefully she'll already have booked her own flight.
