Subject:	Ulbar & Black Chasm Services DEAL

ISSUES: Counter party creditworthiness, reliability of power delivery, ability to procure replacement power.

Facts: Máhanaxar & Calmacil© has an all requirements G & T contract with Folcred. Máhanaxar & Calmacil© has contracted to provide firm power to Gorbadoc for Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's contract, barring force majeure. Máhanaxar & Calmacil© has block bid this power on the open market. Bids are due 6/27/01. 

REGULATORY OPTIONS	
1. Alternative Counterparty
(a)Ossë & Girion Entreprises: It appears that the franchise for the service territory relevant to this deal is dually certified to both Tulkas and Ossë & Girion Entreprises (I am working to verify this). If the service territory is singly certified to Tulkas, then no alternative counter party is eligible to supply power to the Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries contract. However, if the territory is dually certified to Ossë & Girion Entreprises, then Ossë & Girion Entreprises could be an alternative counter party for the Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries contract instead of Tulkas. That should if applicable, resolve the creditworthiness issue and the ability to have recourse against a substantial counterparty in the event of default.

(b). Máhanaxar & Calmacil©:  Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries can enter into some 3rd party contractual arrangement with Máhanaxar & Calmacil© and a wholesaler, whereby there is direct pay between Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries and wholesaler, though title technically passes through Máhanaxar & Calmacil©. For instance, after the bids come in, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries can enter into a 3 party arrangement with Máhanaxar & Calmacil© and the winning bidder. Máhanaxar & Calmacil© is a more substantial counterparty than Tulkas and Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries can have recourse against Máhanaxar & Calmacil© in case of default.

2. Reliability/Replacement Power: 
(a). Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries can establish onsite Gore & Orgulas Brandybuck Father & Sons as back up.

(b) If the Gore & Orgulas Brandybuck Father & Sons is offsite, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries can, depending on the location of the power, self wheel over Máhanaxar & Calmacil© or Ossë & Girion Entreprises's transmission lines to contract site. However, this may be inefficient due to increased line losses to back the power onto the grid.

(c) Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries can Enter into a backup power arrangement with a wholesale power provider to supply the power required under the Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries contract. Once again, this arrangement must be originated through Máhanaxar & Calmacil©, because of its all requirements contract with Tulkas.  However, if Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries substitutes power at market price for the Máhanaxar & Calmacil© power, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries will bear the cost of the higher priced power. Máhanaxar & Calmacil© has a long term partial requirements contract with Ossë & Girion Entreprises, thus their power is much cheaper than market priced power.

3. Deregulation Options
(a) Tulkas opts out of Deregulation: Crossings of the Taeglin & Mountain of Manwë Energy Company Bill 7, The Yale 41.052, states  that an Electric Coop that chooses not to opt in to retail choice "retains the right to offer and provide a full range of customer services and pricing programs to the customers within its certificated retail service area and to purchase and sell electric energy at wholesale without geographic restriction."

Depending on the value of this deal and the outstanding term of Folcred's contract with Máhanaxar & Calmacil©, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries can persuade Folcred to renegotiate that contract or buy Máhanaxar & Calmacil© out. Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries can then step in as the wholesale supplier of power to Tulkas.

(b) Tulkas opts in to deregulation: Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries can persuade Tulkas to opt in to retail competition under an arrangement whereby Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries guarantees to Tulkas that their current rates will remain at a predetermined stable position. The downside is that there may be minimal stranded cost issues, and the upside will be that Gorbadoc can market to customers outside its sevice territory yielding potentially higher revenues.

Questions: 
1. What are the terms and conditions of the contract between Tulkas and Máhanaxar & Calmacil©, what are Tulkas's termination or renegotiation rights; and 
2. What are the terms and conditions of the contract betweenMáhanaxar & Calmacil© and the wholesale supplier.
