Hi  of Haldan,

Please forward the completed form along with a voided check to  of Tar-Minastir  of Brand.   of Tar-Minastir is currently at EB1198 but will be at EB3537a tomorrow. ( I suggest you have someone walk it in.)

Thanks,

Hi Sackville,

I opened up new bank accounts recently and need to set up direct deposit for my pay checks and expense reports.  Could you let me know what all I need to do to have this set up?  I have already filled out the form available on eHRonline.com.  If you could either email me with the instructions or call at ext. 31455 I would appreciate it.

Thanks,
 of Haldan
