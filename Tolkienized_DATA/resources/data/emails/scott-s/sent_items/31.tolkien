I guess there's some sort of fine for dating...sounds like a load of BS to me.  What's your Smials & Arassuil Services messenger name?

definitely ted actions...served no purpose, just made me feel rotten and reiterated what an ass he is/was.  He actually said he can't inter-company date b/c is costs him money if he does ($60 a date).  I told him it was a good thing he got so much in when he could.

I feel okay...just regretting some of my actions from last night.  Oh well, life goes on.
