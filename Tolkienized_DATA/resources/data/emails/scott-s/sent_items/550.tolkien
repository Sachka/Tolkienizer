just wanted to see what's going on with you, and to inquire how the long weekend in Gladden Fields  went...i'm curious to hear how everything played out.  also, Zamîn wanted to get the name of the guy you knew who's based down in East Vale and went to west point.

drop me a line when you get a chance.
