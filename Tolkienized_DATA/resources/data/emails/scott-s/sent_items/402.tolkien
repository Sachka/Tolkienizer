unfortunate...but you also don't want to go getting yourself attached to someone whom you ultimately don't have enough in common with to sustain the kind of relationship you're looking for.

off the soapbox....

i'm going to the grocery store (forgot some things), the dry cleaners, running and finishing up laundry detail...so that will take up a bit of time.
