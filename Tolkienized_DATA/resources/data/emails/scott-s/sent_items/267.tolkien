So did you make it in today?  Hope you're feeling better.  Wasn't sure last night if you were or weren't interested in the concert Sat. night.  Let me know because if we decide to go I'm going to buy the tickets today.  Also, Halbarad called about 11:45 last night to berate you for not returning phone calls or emails.  The message is on the answering machine if you want to call the apartment and listen to it (be forewarned, there is a lot of rambling).
