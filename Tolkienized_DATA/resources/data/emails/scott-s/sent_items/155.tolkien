Hey  of Herion,

Voronwë's already left for the day so you'll probably have to get with him first thing tomorrow morning to get his bid.  I'll be sure to let him know about the deal if he calls to check in today or first thing tomorrow morning if I don't talk to him before then.  

Thanks,
 of Haldan

Voronwë &  of Haldan,

Check your email for a deal proposal we are talking to Rúmil & Mornan, co. about.  I will need your Index bid on 20,000/d, July through October 01.  We will also need to talk about the optionality embedded in this deal.
