I just wanted to make sure that you had a chance to speak with Belen son of Adalgar.  I thought of him when you mentioned possible candidates for the other open position as he was with our scheduling group and is, I believe, from that area of the country.  If you haven't had the opportunity to establish contact with him please let me know and I will be sure to get each of you the other's contact information.  Hope all is going well with you and I'll talk to you soon.

Thanks,
 of Haldan
