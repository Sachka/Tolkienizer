I'm thinking about driving to Emyn Eglain this weekend to see Calacirya & Peony Baggins Services's new house as well as the two of them and the kids.  Just wanted to see what you were going to be up to and if you might want to get together.  I know you still have to work at the Law Review, but I figure you won't be there 24 hrs. a day...course I could be wrong.

Talk to you soon,
Sue
