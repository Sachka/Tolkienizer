See...I told you you were invited.  I think I must have dropped the invitation or something.  Let me know what you think.  I'd been planning on going to the Daisy daughter of Tar-Ancalimon concert Sat night at the Fab Satellite Lounge (along with  of Angelimar, Herugar, and yourself if you were interested).  Honestly think I'd rather go to the concert, but I would feel somewhat guilty.  What are your thoughts?
