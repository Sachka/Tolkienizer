See...I told you you were invited.  I think I must have dropped the invitation or something.  Let me know what you think.  I'd been planning on going to the Morwen daughter of Hatholdir concert Sat night at the Fab Satellite Lounge (along with  of Angelimar, Faramir, and yourself if you were interested).  Honestly think I'd rather go to the concert, but I would feel somewhat guilty.  What are your thoughts?
