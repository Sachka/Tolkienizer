Great to hear from you! I was beginning to think that I ought to send the Noirinan & Emyn Duir Services to find your whereabouts and retrieve you.  You really didn't miss much on Tuesday since Gilraen came with me and we left early.
Would love to see the watch. It sounds divine. Drop me a note and lets do a drink sometime....

Oh boo-hoo...cry me a river.

Sorry I missed Tuesday, but I went to listen to live music with a friend from UT.  How are things going with you?  I had a great time in East Emnet and came back with some Cubans for Dad and a 1920's platinum and diamond watch for myself...can't wait for you to see it.  Give me a call sometime, would like to hear what's new in your life.
