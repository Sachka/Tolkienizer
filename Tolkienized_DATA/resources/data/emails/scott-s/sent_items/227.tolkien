Trading'em up old chap....Malantur was out Friday, yesterday and is still out today so the Bosco Boffin & Stockbrook Energy Company are all under my command.  It's been a bit on the chaotic side the last two days so I've really just been trying to maintain sanity.  As always, it is a pleasure to hear from you and I would love to gather sometime and flex the brain muscle on something other than bid/offer and spreads.

Ciao,
 of Éothain

What are you doing? Where have you been? Anardil and I feel so alone....like a sheep without as shepherd....etc.
We have been having to spend out Saturday nights at South Road, Beleriand & Hyarastorni Father & Sons.... :)
What's the good word?
