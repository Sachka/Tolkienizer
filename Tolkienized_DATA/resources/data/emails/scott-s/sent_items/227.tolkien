Trading'em up old chap....Voronwë was out Friday, yesterday and is still out today so the Bay of Balar & Herucalmo Entreprises are all under my command.  It's been a bit on the chaotic side the last two days so I've really just been trying to maintain sanity.  As always, it is a pleasure to hear from you and I would love to gather sometime and flex the brain muscle on something other than bid/offer and spreads.

Ciao,
 of Haldan
