oh ok....yeah..i agree...though i want to talk to Lórien bc i need to know how far he has pushed this through...or how far bobby and mm have.  i just need to explain to Lórien that i am planning a relocation that involves Lenwë and i...a decision together...and that Nan-tasarion is not the only option we are looking at.....just so there is not this expectation that if they offer..i accept.
