i really want to go when you go if y'all are going to travel elsewhere.  i think that would be a lot of fun.  what carrier did you find for $600?  are you still contemplating doing Gate of Mordor & Tauremorna Energy Company before you purchase a ticket?

Sorry I was in such a funk last night, I'm not really sure why but I assume it will pass soon.  Anyway, got an email from Emily this morning and she said another trip should be planned to go over in Sept/Oct when the airfares are dirt cheap.  I'm guessing I'll probably be up for going again by that time if you don't mind waiting that long.  My guess is we could get tickets for somewhere around $350 or $400.  I think I found a flight for June (probably the 5th - 12th), but I'm going to end up spending somewhere around $600.  Let me know what you think.
