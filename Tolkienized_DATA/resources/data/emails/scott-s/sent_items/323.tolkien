Hope you had fun yesterday...I was actually writing to see if you had any interest in going to Emyn Eglain this weekend.  Emily, Éowyn, myself and possibly  of Holman are talking about making a trip up there tomorrow.  We would be going out with some guy friends of ours so if Herugar wanted to come he wouldn't be completely outnumbered.  Also, one of Éowyn's friends manages Wilcome son of Ardamir and he's playing at Amon Darthir & Shire® so we were thinking about trying to go see him on Saturday.  Drop me a line and let me know if you have any interest.
