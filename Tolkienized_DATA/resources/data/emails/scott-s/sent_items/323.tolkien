Hope you had fun yesterday...I was actually writing to see if you had any interest in going to Emyn Eglain this weekend.  Emily, Finduilas, myself and possibly  of Niënor are talking about making a trip up there tomorrow.  We would be going out with some guy friends of ours so if Faramir wanted to come he wouldn't be completely outnumbered.  Also, one of Finduilas's friends manages Barliman son of Tata and he's playing at Hador & Kingsland Energy Company so we were thinking about trying to go see him on Saturday.  Drop me a line and let me know if you have any interest.
