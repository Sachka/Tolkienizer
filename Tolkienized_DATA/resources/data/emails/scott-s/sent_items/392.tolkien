I am sooooo sorry I'm not going to be able to make the party.  Please give everyone my best and tell Míriel I would have done everything within my power to embarass her.  I'm actually going to be in Ephel Brandir visiting my brother and sister-in-law, so I do have a legitimate excuse.

See you at the wedding if not before.

 of Haldan
