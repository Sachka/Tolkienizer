ISSUES: Counter party creditworthiness, reliability of power delivery, ability to procure replacement power.

Facts: Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services has an all requirements G & T contract with Tulkas. Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services has contracted to provide firm power to Orophin for Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.'s contract, barring force majeure. Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services has block bid this power on the open market. Bids are due 6/27/01. 

REGULATORY OPTIONS	
1. Alternative Counterparty
(a)Belegund & Anduin, Ethir Services: It appears that the franchise for the service territory relevant to this deal is dually certified to both Fengel and Belegund & Anduin, Ethir Services (I am working to verify this). If the service territory is singly certified to Fengel, then no alternative counter party is eligible to supply power to the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. contract. However, if the territory is dually certified to Belegund & Anduin, Ethir Services, then Belegund & Anduin, Ethir Services could be an alternative counter party for the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. contract instead of Fengel. That should if applicable, resolve the creditworthiness issue and the ability to have recourse against a substantial counterparty in the event of default.

(b). Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services:  Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. can enter into some 3rd party contractual arrangement with Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services and a wholesaler, whereby there is direct pay between Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. and wholesaler, though title technically passes through Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services. For instance, after the bids come in, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. can enter into a 3 party arrangement with Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services and the winning bidder. Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services is a more substantial counterparty than Fengel and Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. can have recourse against Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services in case of default.

2. Reliability/Replacement Power: 
(a). Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. can establish onsite Mountains of Shadow (Ephel Dúath) & Doderic Brandybuck® as back up.

(b) If the Mountains of Shadow (Ephel Dúath) & Doderic Brandybuck® is offsite, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. can, depending on the location of the power, self wheel over Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services or Belegund & Anduin, Ethir Services's transmission lines to contract site. However, this may be inefficient due to increased line losses to back the power onto the grid.

(c) Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. can Enter into a backup power arrangement with a wholesale power provider to supply the power required under the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. contract. Once again, this arrangement must be originated through Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services, because of its all requirements contract with Fengel.  However, if Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. substitutes power at market price for the Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services power, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. will bear the cost of the higher priced power. Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services has a long term partial requirements contract with Belegund & Anduin, Ethir Services, thus their power is much cheaper than market priced power.

3. Deregulation Options
(a) Fengel opts out of Deregulation: Elboron & Galion® Bill 7, The Yale 41.052, states  that an Electric Coop that chooses not to opt in to retail choice "retains the right to offer and provide a full range of customer services and pricing programs to the customers within its certificated retail service area and to purchase and sell electric energy at wholesale without geographic restriction."

Depending on the value of this deal and the outstanding term of Tulkas's contract with Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. can persuade Tulkas to renegotiate that contract or buy Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services out. Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. can then step in as the wholesale supplier of power to Fengel.

(b) Fengel opts in to deregulation: Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. can persuade Fengel to opt in to retail competition under an arrangement whereby Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. guarantees to Fengel that their current rates will remain at a predetermined stable position. The downside is that there may be minimal stranded cost issues, and the upside will be that Orophin can market to customers outside its sevice territory yielding potentially higher revenues.

Questions: 
1. What are the terms and conditions of the contract between Fengel and Land of Caranthir & Mahtan Services, what are Fengel's termination or renegotiation rights; and 
2. What are the terms and conditions of the contract betweenLand of Caranthir & Mahtan Services and the wholesale supplier.
