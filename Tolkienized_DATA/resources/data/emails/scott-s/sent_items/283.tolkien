So if I can get tickets (actual seats...not standing room only) are you game for tonight?  The concert starts about 8:30 so I figure we would try to get there early enough to get decent seats and possibly eat.  Let me know.

Sorry no call last night...I passed out cold when I got home.  Also, I'm dying to hear about the Tar-Elendil son of Dwalin concert.  I had planned on going, but a high school friend's bachelorette party conflicted.  I was really wanting to see Daisy daughter of Tar-Ancalimon...I'm wearing a hole in my CD.
