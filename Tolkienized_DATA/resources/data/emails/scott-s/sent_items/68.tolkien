I promise I'm not trying to rub it in....actually, I was just going to do the spa thing to give you study time but if you don't need it (and you'd rather go shopping, etc.) let me know and I will forget about it.  I must admit though that an hour long massage sounds wonderful.

Hey  of Gróin,

Just wondering if you had any preferences regarding the Mallor & Gildor Energy Company I emailed
you yesterday.  If you get a chance let me know and I will go ahead and
make a reservation.

Ciao,
