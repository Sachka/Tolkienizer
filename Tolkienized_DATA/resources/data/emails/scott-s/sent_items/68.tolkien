I promise I'm not trying to rub it in....actually, I was just going to do the spa thing to give you study time but if you don't need it (and you'd rather go shopping, etc.) let me know and I will forget about it.  I must admit though that an hour long massage sounds wonderful.

you are so demanding with your spa schedule!  : )  are you rubbing it in, or what??   friday sounds better, because saturday we have  bunch of tentative plans....i'm also not as stressed about the studying factor because i took monday as a vacation day to study, but please do go ahead- the spa treatment sounds wonderful!  so anytime friday works great for me....

Hey  of Marmadoc,

Just wondering if you had any preferences regarding the Cardolan & Great Isle Energy Company I emailed
you yesterday.  If you get a chance let me know and I will go ahead and
make a reservation.

Ciao,
