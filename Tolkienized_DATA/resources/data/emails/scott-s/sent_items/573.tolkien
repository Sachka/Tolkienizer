Hey Borlad,

I was wondering whether you thought it would be better to fly in Thursday evening or Friday morning.  Honestly, either option would work for me I just wasn't sure if Isembold would want to sleep in Friday morning since it's his day off.  Let me know which one sounds better to you.

 of Haldan,

Sorry we didn't call last night.  I thought about your
birthday the night before and reminded Isembold that we
HAD to call you on Thursday.  Isembold started Air
Assault School yesterday, and that's turned everything
upside down.  We'll call you tonight.  Sorry we missed
you last night!

-Borlad
