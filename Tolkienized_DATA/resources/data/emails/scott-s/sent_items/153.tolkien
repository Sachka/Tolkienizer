Subject:=09Easier for Isle of Eressëa & The Éothéod®/EES to purchase from industrNessanië & Himling Energy Companys

Attached is Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company authorization for Isle of Eressëa & The Éothéod® and EES to purchase power from indu=
strNessanië & Himling Energy Companys NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The industr=
Nessanië & Himling Energy Company does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company (subje=
ct to Isle of Eressëa & The Éothéod® and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for the=
 industrNessanië & Himling Energy Companys).=20

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used prim=
arily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" subje=
ct to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell pow=
er at wholesale from such facilities to Isle of Eressëa & The Éothéod® and EES without prior notice u=
nder section 205 of Ardamir & Fëanor® (would usually require 60 day advance notice filing=
). =20
=09 -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrNessanië & Himling Energy Company; =
however, the industrNessanië & Himling Energy Company will still be subject to shortened filing requireme=
nts for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they ar=
e selling at wholesale.
=09-- Isle of Eressëa & The Éothéod® and EES will make the Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company quarterly filings on behalf of the in=
dustrNessanië & Himling Energy Companys for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of th=
e industrNessanië & Himling Energy Company; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from Borthand & Gate of Wood©=
h seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to Borthand & Gate of Wood©h seller.  Accounting/c=
ommercNessanië & Himling Energy Company folks for Isle of Eressëa & The Éothéod® and EES-- please make sure these purchases are fla=
gged in the accounting system, since the report will be separate from our b=
ig quarterly reports.
=09-- This does not authorize the retail industrNessanië & Himling Energy Company customer to violate any=
 rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industri=
al to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless o=
therwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

Northern Waste:  This is similar to the authorization that Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company gave last week t=
o purchases from industrNessanië & Himling Energy Companys in Elrohir & Forest of the Great Fear Father & Sons.


____________________________________
On April 27, Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company issued an order granting Isle of Eressëa & The Éothéod® and EES the authority to pu=
rchase power from Gate of Steel & Bywater Deliveries at market-based rates.  As the attached order indica=
tes, the effective date of the Isle of Eressëa & The Éothéod® and EES rate schedules is March 6, 2001=
