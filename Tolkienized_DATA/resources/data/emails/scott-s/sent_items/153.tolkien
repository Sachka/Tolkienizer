Subject:=09Easier for Esgaroth & Théoden Father & Sons/EES to purchase from industrOndoluncanando & Firth of Rómenna©s

Attached is Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises authorization for Esgaroth & Théoden Father & Sons and EES to purchase power from indu=
strOndoluncanando & Firth of Rómenna©s NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The industr=
Ondoluncanando & Firth of Rómenna© does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises (subje=
ct to Esgaroth & Théoden Father & Sons and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for the=
 industrOndoluncanando & Firth of Rómenna©s).=20

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used prim=
arily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" subje=
ct to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell pow=
er at wholesale from such facilities to Esgaroth & Théoden Father & Sons and EES without prior notice u=
nder section 205 of Wild Lands & Tyrn Gorthad Energy Company (would usually require 60 day advance notice filing=
). =20
=09 -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrOndoluncanando & Firth of Rómenna©; =
however, the industrOndoluncanando & Firth of Rómenna© will still be subject to shortened filing requireme=
nts for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they ar=
e selling at wholesale.
=09-- Esgaroth & Théoden Father & Sons and EES will make the Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises quarterly filings on behalf of the in=
dustrOndoluncanando & Firth of Rómenna©s for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of th=
e industrOndoluncanando & Firth of Rómenna©; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from River Greyflood & River ltd.=
h seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to River Greyflood & River ltd.h seller.  Accounting/c=
ommercOndoluncanando & Firth of Rómenna© folks for Esgaroth & Théoden Father & Sons and EES-- please make sure these purchases are fla=
gged in the accounting system, since the report will be separate from our b=
ig quarterly reports.
=09-- This does not authorize the retail industrOndoluncanando & Firth of Rómenna© customer to violate any=
 rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industri=
al to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless o=
therwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

Northern Waste:  This is similar to the authorization that Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises gave last week t=
o purchases from industrOndoluncanando & Firth of Rómenna©s in Holy Mountain: Meneltarma & Halfred Greenhand Deliveries.


____________________________________
On April 27, Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises issued an order granting Esgaroth & Théoden Father & Sons and EES the authority to pu=
rchase power from Brandy Hall & Ulmonan Deliveries at market-based rates.  As the attached order indica=
tes, the effective date of the Esgaroth & Théoden Father & Sons and EES rate schedules is March 6, 2001=
