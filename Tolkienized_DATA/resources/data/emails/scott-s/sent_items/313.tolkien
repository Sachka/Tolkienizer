Haleth,

Please send this note to all identified participants in the Transmission Round Table-

To all Transmission Round Table participants:

Please think about this proposed project and keep involved with suggestions and information as you receive such.  Be prepared to discuss proposal at the next "Round Table" and offer remarks via e-mail to any appropriate Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries person, but particulars to Bifur Coffer.

"Current Transmission Project"

Initial concept of Mandate and Plan of Action

1) Pinpoint restrictions in the Transmission system and then develop a strategy for profiting by mitigation or other actions.  

This is an effort that should be spread company wide with everyone who works with Transmission or learns a detail that relates to Transmission.

2) Use our "Transmission Round Table" to gather the knowledge and ideas that we need to formulate our strategy.

Share this knowledge through a website to be set up.

Activate all who work with Transmission or have any good ideas on the subject.

3) Develop a team to do the required work under a mandate from Baranor son of Basso; directed by Bifur Coffer.

4) Develop strategies for working with each type of competing regional Transmission entities. (Hay Gate & Caverns of Helm's Deep Energy Company, Griffo Boffin & Minardil Entreprises, RTO)

5) List pertinent Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries web pages, what should be on them, and who to talk to about the information contained in each.

6) Go to work now!
