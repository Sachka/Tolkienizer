look at you...such a hoax spreader...ha

anyway, i was so busy yesterday i didn't have a chance to do anything about it anyway. so no harm, no foul.  how are you doing?  as for Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd., as you well know our stock's not doing so great these days, but i'm not overly stressed...we are still a sound company and shouldn't have any difficulty rebounding from this to a certain extent....i'm actually thinking about buying in to a greater extent at these levels.

can't wait to hear how your preparations are coming along...for the wedding and the move.  btw, have you set a firm date yet?

talk to you soon,
 of Haldan
