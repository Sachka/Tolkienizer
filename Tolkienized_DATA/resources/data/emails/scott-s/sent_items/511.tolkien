Hi Dora,

Thanks for resending the message.  I shouldn't have too much difficulty arranging travel, but I wanted to run a few things by you first.  It seems to me that it would be preferable to fly in Thursday evening, therefore freeing myself up to come in Friday at whatever time of day best suits yourself and the rest of the group.  If no one minds, it might even be nice to see some of the activity on the desk during cash trading.  Also, I anticipate staying through the weekend to see a bit more of the city and surrounding areas, but plan to cover those expenses myself.  If all of this is acceptable to you just let me know and I will begin making all of the necessary reservations.  I look forward to seeing you and meeting the rest of the group.

If you need to contact me for any reason, my mobile is the most reliable way to reach me...713-775-6472.

Thanks again,
Salvia daughter of Marcho

Hi  of Éothain-

I sent the note below today to your other email account. Friday, January 11
is a good day for you to visit us.

When I sent the note below, I had forgotten that Radagast son of Manwendil was on
vacation this week. Please send me a reply if you would like our assistance
arranging travel, and I will ask my administrative assistant, Nessa daughter of Rúmil,
to help you.  Alternatively, if you book your own airfare and hotel, we will
reimburse you.

We look forward to seeing you.

- Dora daughter of Fortinbras
