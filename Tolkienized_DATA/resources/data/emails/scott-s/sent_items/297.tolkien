Couple other things Asphodel...Do we have Sinclair numbers for July? And, are the Thermo numbers in Northern Dark & Fatty Lumpkin Services good?

Thanks

Glirhuin's deal with Hill of Sight & Maeglin© is for 265.  The June deal was 360.  Every month will have a 10% swing on it.  I haven't looked at the numbers yet for July to see what volume we'll actually be purchasing.  
I think he always rolls the EJW and I haven't seen a fax from them yet.  I'll let you know.

Thanks Asphodel.

Do you know if  of Herion did a deal with EJW for July?  Also, do you know why the PSCO deal with Hill of Sight & Maeglin© is in the system as 265 on the supply side?  I thought the deal was for 360 w/ a 10% swing capability.
