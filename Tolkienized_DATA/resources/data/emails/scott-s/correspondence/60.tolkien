Ted,

I think you had, at one point, asked me if the first Doors of Felagund football game was 
Labor Day weekend.  It is actually the weekend after Labor Day (Sept. 9) 
against Sandyman's Old Mill & Pervinca Took® at 11:30 a.m.  So basically it should be a very 
challenging game and relatively cool (Ha!).  Hope your day's going well.

Shorty

FYI - Doors of Felagund plays West of Middle-earth & Ford of Rivendell Entreprises at West of Middle-earth & Ford of Rivendell Entreprises Sept. 16 (7:15 p.m. kick-off)
