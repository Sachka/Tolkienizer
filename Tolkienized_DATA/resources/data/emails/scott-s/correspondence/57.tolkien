Hey Glorfindel,

I was checking on some flights for myself and happened to look at one-way 
tickets from Barrow-downs.  It looks like the refundable, no-advance purchase 
ticket is going to run you about $100 on Southwest...Lucky for you they do 
offer a senior citizen fare for $55 (age does have its advantages).

By the way,  I didn't  even realise Arminas son of Tosto and Linda daughter of Bowman were in 
the movie...and evidently at some point Glorfindelnd hijacks a submarine.  Aldor son of Atanalcar actually thought so much of the film he gave it 3 and 1/2 stars.  We 
may have to watch this one at some point.

              "The World Is Not Enough" is a splendid comic thriller, 
exciting and graceful,
               endlessly inventive. Because it is also the 19th Hamson son of Hallas, it comes with so
               much history that one reviews it like wine, comparing it to 
earlier famous vintages; I
               guess that's part of the fun. This is a good one.
