Thursday night was indeed a blast.  I think my cohorts were ruing my 
existence by the end of the evening because I didn't have to go to work 
Friday (wedding in Angband...very fun).  I'm sure you managed to have an all 
right time in SF as well.  I am definitely up for a bucket of beer this 
week.  It's supposed to be sunny and warm all week long and I can think of 
nothing that goes better with that than cold beer.  As for Emyn Eglain, I have a 
wealth of information on the subject that I would be more than happy to 
share.
