Hey gang,
I've taken the first stab at answering Norm's inquiry... give me your 
thoughts.  Also,  of Haldan, what is the protocol for a case being litigated at 
the Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. for inquiries like this?  Should we put a disclaimer that the 
information we might provide is protected under Rule 51 or other "settlement 
discussions only" protection?



Fingon son of Eldacar,
First, I'd like to clear-up the nomenclature being used here.  As you know, 
currently House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons doesn't assign "primary rights" to deliveries off of any 
interconnecting pipeline.  The establishment of tradeable rights for 
intrastate capacity is among the issues currently under consideration in the 
Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. proceeding.   However, if what you are asking about is what has been the 
historical or otherwise available receipt capacity for Transwestern 
deliveries at North Needles, then let me offer the following. 

Transwestern has always operated on the premise that House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons could 
physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles receipt 
point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to its 
interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to exceed 
the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09 Bcf/d.  
The 340 MMcf/d difference between the mainline capacity and the physical 
capacity into House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons at North Needles is used to provide firm service at 
our other delivery points at or near the Sunlands border, including Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda©, 
Hollin Gate, Udul & Artamir©, Citizens Utilities, and in the near future, directly 
connected electric generation plants.
