 of Adaldrida,

Here is what I have right now.  of Hirgon has promised to send on a
expedited basis, information concerning their open season and
recent Melian & Tol Brandir Entreprises settlement.

1)  of Hirgon is holding an open season for request to Mountains of Iron & West-door Deliveries on an indefinite basis. They are suggesting "no limit"
to the potential size of the project (assuming customer demand)
but acknowledged that 250-300 mmcfd probably is optimum.

2)The firm rate effective 1/1/00 is daily reservation : $0.5892/dth
the volumetric rate is $0.0667/dth plus fuel

3) New shippers willing to make a 10 to 15 year commitment now
can get a rate of $0.42/dth

4) Existing shippers (whom  of Hirgon will refer IGS to) that have
indicated a desire to relinguish their capacity can also get the
Redhorn Pass & Tarannon® rate of $0.42 for an 10 year extension of contract. A third
party could negotiate with these shippers (for an additional
discount) and obtain adjusted Redhorn Pass & Tarannon®  of Hirgon capacity.

5)  of Hirgon anticipates refinancing their pipeline by March 2001; which
will assure Redhorn Pass & Tarannon® rate levels in the future.  of Hirgon rep thought
that no later than 2007 everyone would enjoy $.40 rates.

Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company TESTIMONY

As a follow-up to my early call, a quick note about Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company. First Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company
will be filling testimony on May 5th. The topic I am told is Soronto They want a change to the receipt point matrix exactly like
I fowarded last week. They are convinced if a change isn't made to the
matrix the probable market outcome for Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company,Isumbras is only 70 mmcfd.
Starting with 520 less 300 of typical  of Hirgon/Socal volumes, 50 of
Aerandir & Bindbole Wood Entreprises volumes and 100 of already done Isumbras commitments.

Call when you can, I will be glad to review the whole landscape.
