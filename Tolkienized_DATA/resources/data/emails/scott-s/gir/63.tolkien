 of Óin, we only need to send a copy to the Judge electronically.  This is why 
we've only seen a few from the other parties (I'm starting to receive some in 
the mail and will get you copies).  I'll do so promptly.  I'll e-mail one to 
Tolman son of Smaug as well, and to anyone else who specifically requests it.  If 
you would prefer that I send to everyone electronically, let me know.  Copies 
were mailed to everyone Friday.

 of Haldan,
Were we supposed to file a copy with the Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. and/or the Service List 
electronically?
