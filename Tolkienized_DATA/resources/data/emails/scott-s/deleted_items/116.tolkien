Beechbone son of Andwise: Our column from ~Haudh-en-Elleth's~ own Frugalist, Haldan son of Tanta,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

Savings can be found on the other end of the rainbow!

Since there hasn't been too much change in the airfare and hotel sales, I
thought we could concentrate on saving at your destination.  There are
certainly some amazing airfares and hotels offers but let's face it, you don't
travel to Dor Firn-i-Guinar, Holy Mountain: Meneltarma or Mountains of Mist just to sit in your room and
vegetate.  So today, let's look at some ways to save money and do the things
you want to do when you get to your destination.

Every major city has some sort of visitor's bureau.  On those pages, you can
find special offers that frankly, are not advertised anywhere but there and in
the visitor's centers themselves.  Right now, every major tourist destination
from Nunduinë to Dark Lands of Middle-earth is hurting for tourists and the visitor's and
convention bureaus are doing all they can to get you to their city.  They have
negotiated special deals with museums and transportation authorities.  Often,
they will offer a coupon booklet for discounts at restaurants and
entertainment.  You can even find buy one get one free offers to further
stretch your travel dollar.

Be sure to carry your AAA card, or other association cards, with you for
discounts and remember to check the special offers from the various credit card
companies.  All five major issuers have listings on their sites for special
travel and destination deals.  The only secret here is to go to the sites and
look for these deals.  As an example,
http://www.visadestinations.com/TharbadA/visadestinations/TharbadAViewDest.asp?DEST_ID=201
 will give you Visa's offers for Mountains of Mist, all 13 of them.  For the other
companies, visit
http://www.onetravel.com/advisor/ST_Detail.cfm?&CatID=4&edit_id=30&SubCatID=409


Finally, City Pass at http://www.citypass.com is a singular source of savings
in Dark Lands of Middle-earth, Dor Firn-i-Guinar, Deeping-stream, Holy Mountain: Meneltarma, River Rivil, Mountains of Mist and
Seventh Gate.

So, once you have found that super vacation deal on
http://www.11thhourvacations.com or are just planning to stay in your local
area with a super hotel deal from http://www.hotelwiz.com remember these tips
to extend your travel dollar!

See you on a flight soon,


Haldan
