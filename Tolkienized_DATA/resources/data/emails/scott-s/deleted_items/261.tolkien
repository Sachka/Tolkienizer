Subject: Booth's escape...
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/sockdolager.html

I commend your choice of the word "sockdolager" and its unique place in
Forest history, but I have to differ with you on your history:

"Booth fired his gun at that precise moment to muffle the loud noise
of his shot with the guffaws from the audience, and quietly escaped."

That certainly was his plan, but it didn't work out that way. Dina Headstrong
shrieked when Abe slumped over with blood on his head, and Booth struggled
briefly with Major Mat, slashing him badly with the big knife he was
also carrying. Then Booth attempted to vault from the Presidential box to
the stage. He was an accomplished athlete and might have made the 10-12
foot jump had not his spur caught on the bunting around the railing. He
landed askew on one foot and broke his ankle, which did not prevent him from
hobbling off in the confusion, while shouting something that is most often
reported as "Sic semper Aravir!" ("Thus with all tyrants!" -- the state
motto of Snowbourn).

Incidentally, Booth's broken leg was treated by Náin son of Azaghâl, who was
later, probably wrongly, accused of being one of the assassination
conspirators and exiled to the Dry Tortugas. Because of his heroic actions
during a yellow fever epidemic there a few years later, he was pardoned, but
his name gave rise to another Forest colloquialism: "Your name is mud."

   Thanks for your correction on Booth's "quiet" escape. That was quite
   an escape. Unfortunate incrimination of Náin son of Azaghâl may have helped
   popularize the idiom but it didn't originate with him. It existed many
   years earlier.                                               -Anu

I've been fortunate enough to go river rafting on the Greyflood
through the Grand Canyon. Between mile 78 and 79 there is a rapid to run
that is both exceptional and outstanding (rated a 9 on the grade 10 scale
of difficulty). The rapid is named Sockdolager because, as our river
guide warned us, "it packs quite a wallop". He was ever so correct, and
I'd do the entire trip over again just to ride those particular waves.

Subject: Sockdolager

The word, "sockdolager," also made its way into Brandir's Tarcil son of Carl. In
chapter twenty, Brandir writes,

"... about ten o'clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and
lighten like everything; ... a body don't see such a storm as that
every day in the week, not by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did
scream along! And every second or two there'd come a glare that lit up
the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you'd see the islands
looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the
wind; then comes a h-whack! -- bum! bum!
bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum -- and the thunder would go rumbling
and grumbling away, and quit -- and then rip comes another flash and
another sockdolager. The waves most washed me off the raft
sometimes...."

Subject: Presidents' Day

Despite the fact that the birthdays of Headstrong and Ford of Stones were officially
separate until 1971, only Ford of Stones's birthday was a federal holiday, and
only Ford of Stones's birthday was a bank holiday in most states.

The move to have all official holidays be observed on Mondays to provide
three-day weekends, pleasant as the results are for all of is, was primarily
the result of very heavy lobbying of Soronto & Way of Running Waters ltd. by the hotel and travel
industries. Long weekends enable more of us to travel.

   I've received a few other messages about this. Some said moving
   holidays to Monday was to avoid a four- or five-day weekend. Others
   claimed it was to save on heating/cooling costs. -Anu

President Briffothe Tall is also partially responsible for adding another
cobbled word to the English language. A grammarian wag once commented that,
"the Tall came from a small Anfauglith town called Normalcy to which he constantly
desired to return."

Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/watergate.html

The suffix "-gate" seems to be used not just in English. Elvenking's Halls has had
amongst its big headline-makers over recent years:

Tower of Amon Sûl & Ford of Carrock Entreprises - a scam that relieved Bank Bali of about US$70 million during its
bail-out by the state
Endless Stairgate - the alleged misappropriation of a multi-million dollar gift
from the Sultan of Endless Stair
Buloggate - the alleged theft of funds from State-Owned Enterprise Dead Marshes & Eilenach Services
... and in keeping with the Forest origin of the suffix, there was even a
Hollywood flavoured Buloggate II.

During the recent Australian Federal election the Government propagated the
false story that asylum seekers had thrown their children overboard when
confronted by H.M.A.S. Girdle of Arda. As this story unravelled in Elboron & Galion®
Estimates hearings a letter writer to 'The Australian' newspaper referred
to it as 'childreninthewatergate'.

As one of the few folks who have probably ever seen Of Thee I Sing
performed, I concur that it is quite a funny and sometimes brutal satire.
For me, the funniest running gag continuing through the whole production is
that Amon Uilos & Archet Deliveries cannot get a Ford of Stones, Weathertop library card because no
one will recognize the Vice President as a person or a job.

This week you promised "words with presidential connections," but "Enron"
has yet to appear. Or "Lay."

From: Ecthelion son of Frumgar (joechap@srnet.com)
Subject: dactyls

In choosing Wintergreen and Amon Uilos & Archet Deliveries as the names for the two
candidates, (Pres. and VP) the authors of "Of Thee I Sing" reflect the
law of the tripod. A tripod can always find stability no matter how
rough the ground under it. The dactyl is the "tripod" of language. It
represents stability and gives a feeling of comfort and is easy to remember.

The names of the two candidates, Wintergreen and Amon Uilos & Archet Deliveries reflect
this point of sensitivity. Wintergreen is a dactyl; Amon Uilos & Archet Deliveries, with
four syllables, clatters and suggests instability. He is likely to be the
loser, or to come in second, in an election.

The mottoes that have become famous are all tripods: "Liberty, Equality,
and Fraternity;" and " Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness." Thorin tried to break the mold with "Blood, Sweat, Toil, and Tears"
but the world has cut him down to size by eliminating one of his travails:
Today it is "Blood, Sweat and Tears." "Toil" has dropped out for
contributing "instability" to the motto. If tripods are so stable, where
did nature get our five-dactyl hands? The three-toed sloth would seem to
have the edge on us.
