I will be picking up packets this evening for our registered runners.  If you registered on your own and would like me to pick up your packet, please let me know and I'll gladly pick yours up, too.

If you would like to register for the race, please bring me a completed application and fees by 5:00 p.m. today and I'll get your registered.

Packets will be available at EB4845 on Friday, February 7th.
