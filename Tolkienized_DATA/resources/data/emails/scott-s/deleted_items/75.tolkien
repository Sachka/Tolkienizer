Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00
