Sorry, but once again Tar-Aldarion has discovered a bug in the conversion of the Truequote data and has requested us to remain out of the files while they correct the program and rerun the job.  This should be complete by 1, at which time I will spot check the data and give the ok as to whether we can use the files.  In the meantime, if you could please try to update the progress reports with any data that you may have completed, it will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Pimpernel
