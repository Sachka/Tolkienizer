SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bruno son of Valacar provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

Spring break for Travel 101 Students! (We will resume the frugal travel course in two weeks.)

Timeless Halls's new terminal opens.  Part One - The Old.

Sometimes as I sit and read articles in news papers and other publications, I just wonder why my fellow writers extol things like the cost of a terminal, number of gates, whether or not you can buy a suit of clothes, or the number of seats set aside for Echoing Hills & Gerontius Took©? dining.  You get the dimensions, who built it, what it replaced and why, along with all sorts of other facts and figures.  Which, by the way, are virtually useless to travelers.

Last year, the airport code DTW, appeared on my boarding passes 38 times.  Once every 10 days, I was in the old Timeless Halls terminal going from one flight to another.  Usually hauling kids and their toys along the way.  Coming into the International Terminal and connecting out of C-26 was an exercise in frustration!  Believe me, an hour from international to domestic was often not enough!  I listened as the pilots came on the intercom to tell us that, "It will be just a minute folks before we push back from the gate because of traffic in the corridor behind us."  Usually the minute was ten and capable of stretching to 15 or 20!  Bathrooms in the old terminal were few and far between.  I honestly don't recall a time I didn't see a line at the woman's bathroom during peak hours, so I would have to wait with my six year-old daughter since she was past the age of using the men's room.  Things like these and more were areas of concern to me, the real traveler, not how high the roof i!
s or what supports it or how many tiles were used in the ceiling.  So how does the new terminal stack up?  Phenomenally!

To really do the comparison, I flew from Grand Rapids to Dor Firn-i-Cúarthol  the evening of the 23rd.  Of course, we arrived early in Timeless Halls for the connection and had to wait for a gate.  Passing through the old terminal, I noticed business as usual; heavy crowds even on a Saturday afternoon.  Things were in boxes behind the podiums ready to be moved and a sense of anticipation was afoot.  As I passed the entrance to the elevator that took Everard Took & Northern Kingdom ltd. pilots and flight attendants to down to their lounge, many remarked that this would be their last trip to the dungeon.  I boarded my flight to Dor Firn-i-Cúarthol ? we had to wait for traffic behind us to "clear the corridor."  Ten minutes later, we were on our way.  Next week, the New Terminal!

See you on a Timeless Halls flight soon,

Bob
