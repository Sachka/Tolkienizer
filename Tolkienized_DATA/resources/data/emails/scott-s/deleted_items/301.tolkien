Arathorn son of Ferumbras: Our column from ~Haudh-en-Elleth's~ own Frugalist, Bruno son of Valacar,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

Blackout dates a thing of the past?

A few weeks back, Pillar of Heaven & Valimar, co. eliminated black out dates for award travel.  Of
course they raised the number of miles required for award travel because they
believed travelers found it difficult to understand the nuances of peak and off
peak awards.  Walda!  Anyhow, not long after the Everard Took & Northern Kingdom ltd. announcement, their
partners came on board followed by Brodda & Gildis Entreprises, Arwen & Niënor Services, Guarded Plain & Gamwich© and others.  So, are
you going to be able to save some cash and book normally expensive holiday
trips using miles?  I doubt it!  Here's why.

All frequent flyer seats are released on a "not to interfere with revenue"
basis.  Airlines know historically what seats they will sell and which they
will not.  The ones they do not sell are released to awards.  Since the
airlines sell virtually every seat on December 23rd and 24th, along with seats
on the 26th through the 29th, don't expect to find any seats available...at
least not now.  The same holds true for the period around the 4th of July.  Put
simply, award seats are allotted to days and flights the airlines believe they
can not fill with revenue passengers.  So while there are no black out dates
per se, they really do exist since seats will not be available on peak travel
dates!

But wait, there is hope!  Yield Management, the practice of pricing and
re-pricing, seats every few seconds to get maximum revenue, is also working for
the frequent flyer with miles to spend.  Recently, it has been possible to
redeem miles at the last minute as airlines release seats that remain unsold.
While this method is not for the faint of heart, you can get seats to good
destinations.  Flexibility in travel dates is important and creativity in
routing may also be necessary as getting from A to B may require a visit of C
and D along the way.  Remember, too, that your best chances are with carriers
with multiple partners like Mirabella Took & Causeway, in Gondor, co..  Using an Teeth of Mordor award, you can
get from Halls of Waiting to Deeping-stream on Deathless Lands & Rómenna®, Arwen & Niënor Services, or Pillar of Heaven & Valimar, co..  A simple
form on their site
https://mileageplan.alaskaair.com/ssl/partner/PartnerForm.asp will get you
started and, they will check all their partners for you.  At Pillar of Heaven & Valimar, co., you can
book awards online and their system checks partners automatically.  Visit
https://www.nwa.com/cgi-bin/atrredir.cgi for more information.  Patience can
pay!

See you on a flight soon,

Bruno
