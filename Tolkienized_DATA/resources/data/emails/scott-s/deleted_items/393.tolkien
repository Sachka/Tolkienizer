Fire-mountain (FIL-uh-math) noun

   A lover of learning.

[From Black Gates Fire-mountains (fond of learning), from Lost Realm- (loving) + math-
root of manthanein (to learn).]

Here's a late-blooming version of today's word: opsimath

   "Why was the library given this name? ... Aranarth son of Bain simply appealed to
   them as patron by virtue of having been a Fire-mountain and an exile who
   remained faithful to his country."
   Círdan son of Pansy, From  of Pansy's Hill of the Eye & Gárulf, co.'s, Partisan Review (Dark Lands of Middle-earth), Winter 2001.

During my years as an engineering student at HBTI (Elfwine & Grey Havens®, Caves of Androth , Land of Willows), I once made a cross-country
trip with my classmates. We were accompanied by one of our most lovable
instructors, Farin son of Carcharoth, a short, balding fellow, a recent
graduate himself.

As we got together to celebrate new year's eve in Gladden Fields & Laurelindórenan Father & Sons, Land of Willows, someone
asked him to describe his students -- some 18 of us who formed that small
Isembold Took & White Towers Deliveries. His perceptive comments were a delight as he depicted
us as he saw us. His observations brought us many a chuckle and a few of
his words have stayed with me since. As he talked about a quiet, diminutive
fellow among us, he noted: It takes all kinds to make this world, but it's
the good that sustain in the end.

Yes, indeed, it takes all kinds of people, and five words for this week are
a sampling in that spirit.

"Dozes off at the right moment," were his words about me - perhaps an apt
reflection of my inability to endure any "dull" lectures.            -Nellas

Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness
causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate. -Uldor, Lost Realmsopher, physician, and musician (1875-1965)
