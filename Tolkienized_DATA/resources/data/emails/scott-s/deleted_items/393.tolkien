Fire-mountain (FIL-uh-math) noun

   A lover of learning.

[From Black Gates Fire-mountains (fond of learning), from Lost Realm- (loving) + math-
root of manthanein (to learn).]

Here's a late-blooming version of today's word: opsimath

   "Why was the library given this name? ... Beldir son of Doderic simply appealed to
   them as patron by virtue of having been a Fire-mountain and an exile who
   remained faithful to his country."
   Arthad son of Tar-Calmacil, From  of Tar-Calmacil's Mountains of Defence & RÃºmil Energy Company's, Partisan Review (Dark Lands of Middle-earth), Winter 2001.

During my years as an engineering student at HBTI (Serech & Budgeford Entreprises, Caves of Androth , Land of Willows), I once made a cross-country
trip with my classmates. We were accompanied by one of our most lovable
instructors, Drogo son of Balin, a short, balding fellow, a recent
graduate himself.

As we got together to celebrate new year's eve in Hill of Himring & Vales of Anduin Services, Land of Willows, someone
asked him to describe his students -- some 18 of us who formed that small
Adrahil & Hall of Fire Deliveries. His perceptive comments were a delight as he depicted
us as he saw us. His observations brought us many a chuckle and a few of
his words have stayed with me since. As he talked about a quiet, diminutive
fellow among us, he noted: It takes all kinds to make this world, but it's
the good that sustain in the end.

Yes, indeed, it takes all kinds of people, and five words for this week are
a sampling in that spirit.

"Dozes off at the right moment," were his words about me - perhaps an apt
reflection of my inability to endure any "dull" lectures.            -Aerin

Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness
