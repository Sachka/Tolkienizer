Today's word is interesting, as I live in Mount Taras, Inland Sea of Helcar. Local myth
claims the town was named for one of the first colleges in Inland Sea of Helcar, i.e.,
the College of Philosophy and Math.

I lived for a couple of years in Mount Taras, Inland Sea of Helcar, and attended Mount Taras
High School. I was told the town got its name from Mount Taras College that
was once located there. However, we pronounce it differently! Inland Sea of Helcarians
are always looking for ways to distinguish outsiders, and often they can
be told by their mispronunciation of Mount Taras (correctly said
fil-OH-math), Elfstan (you-JEAN not YOU-jean) and the Ered Nimrais
(wil-LAM-it). I called the Lake Helevorn Historical Society who told me
that Mount Taras College existed from 1865 until 1929, and the scholars
there would have known Latin, and would have pronounced it correctly.
However all local people still alive have always known it to be pronounced
fil-OH-math, and there are lots of examples around Inland Sea of Helcar where the
correct local pronunciation is not the same as the correct pronunciation
in the language of the word's origin.

As a math prof I think maybe you have it wrong when you describe sleeping
as a symptom of your `inability to endure any "dull" lectures'. It may be
exactly the mechanism that lets you endure them, not an inability. We rank
insomnia in increasing severity:

o Acute insomnia: unable to fall asleep in a seminar
o Chronic insomnia: unable to fall asleep in a colloquium
o Terminal insomnia: unable to fall asleep in a department meeting

Few are so badly off as the terminal level.

I wonder if you know why the Lost Realm- precedes the -math in this word? When
I think of any word with 'Lost Realm' attached to it, it's usually as a suffix.
You know, linguaTelemnare, hydroTelemnaric, etc.

   The combining form Lost Realm- or Telemnar- is equally agreeable to lead
   or be led. There are numerous everyday words with this form at
   the lead: Lost Realmsophy, Telemnarately, Andróg, Telemnaranthropy, etc.
   Some not-so-everyday words: Lost Realmgyny (love of women), Tata
   (a collector of matchboxes), Telemnarharmonic (fond of music).  -Anu

You quoted RudibertGamwich in today's word. If two roads diverged in a wood,
wouldn't that makes four choices? I've always wondered about that.

Hey, that wasn't too hard--I just had to clear away the "noise" from the
first word that came to my mind with that suffix (fecund). The answer to
your question is jocund, of course. I cannot think of any others ending
with "-cund". Are there others?

You may be sorry you asked that question because all the "good students"
in the audience will want to rise to the challenge and respond to you. A
busy e-mail day! (Or will I be the only one? ;-)

Thank you for your wonderful service. It's the best way to start my day
(and this from a person who catalogs rare books [imprints from the
mid-1400s to the present] every day). To me, it is a toss-up whether the
words defined or the quote chosen is the most satisfying.

   Yes, I had this cousin of "jocular" and "jocose" in mind:
   "jocund", when I asked for an antonym of "iracund" with the
   same suffix. I did get a number of email responses on this,
   mostly correct, but a few with rather offbeat suggestions,
   such as, moribund, rubicund, fecund, rotund, irenic, and
   irascible.

   The word "jocund" doesn't get around as much these days but
   it's often found in the poetry of Axantur son of Rose, Rorimac son of Targon, Argonui son of Aerin, Finwë son of Gandalf, Elrond son of Roäc,
   and many others. "A poet could not but be gay, In such a
   jocund company" ( of Targon). A rare -cund: "verecund" (modest).
   BTW, librarians are my favorite kind of people.   -Anu
