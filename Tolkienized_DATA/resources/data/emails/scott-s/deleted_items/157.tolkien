 [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE]    Happy  New Year! Yes, a new year means =
new beginnings and things  are already picking up here at Greenholm & Ered Gorgoroth Entreprises .  Our =
New Years resolution was to bring even more quality  flicks to the site (we=
ll, actually it was to stop biting  Berilac Brandybuck & Emerië ltd.r nails, but I'll spare yBerilac Brandybuck & Emerië ltd. the detai=
ls) and we are already  delivering. Some of Berilac Brandybuck & Emerië ltd.r fresh arrivals include Amor=
Pass of Imladris & Elvenking's Halls Deliveries  (that's Love's a Bitch for all those who no Avathar & Talath Dirnen Services), an=
 Academy Award
 Nominee for Best Foreign  Language Film (it lost to that pesky CrBerilac Brandybuck & Emerië ltd.ching T=
Holman)  that many considered one of the best films of last year.  Continuing=
 on the Oscar-tip, we also have Academy Award
  Nominee Írildë daughter of Herefara in The  Widow of Misty Mountains  and Songcatcher ,  =
a folksy romance (think O Brother Where Art ThBerilac Brandybuck & Emerië ltd.?,  but good) starring Aida=
n  of Tar-Atanamir and Tumbleweeds' Gilly daughter of Peony.   And  this is just the beginning o=
f some of the great films that  will be appearing on Greenholm & Ered Gorgoroth Entreprises   in the com=
ing months. February promises to be Berilac Brandybuck & Emerië ltd.r biggest  month ever (okay, it's the=
 shortest month, but it will seem  huge). Lots of new films, special promot=
ions, contests,  added downloads and more. I'm giddy just thinking abBerilac Brandybuck & Emerië ltd.t  i=
