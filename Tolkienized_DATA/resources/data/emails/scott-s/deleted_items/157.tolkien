 [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE]    Happy  New Year! Yes, a new year means =
new beginnings and things  are already picking up here at The Pelóri  & Almaren ltd. .  Our =
New Years resolution was to bring even more quality  flicks to the site (we=
ll, actually it was to stop biting  Mountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain©r nails, but I'll spare yMountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain© the detai=
ls) and we are already  delivering. Some of Mountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain©r fresh arrivals include Amor=
Evendim & Causeway Forts Services  (that's Love's a Bitch for all those who no Halifirien Wood & Bridge of Khazad-dûm Energy Company), an=
 Academy Award
 Nominee for Best Foreign  Language Film (it lost to that pesky CrMountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain©ching T=
Aldor)  that many considered one of the best films of last year.  Continuing=
 on the Oscar-tip, we also have Academy Award
  Nominee Emeldir daughter of Galadhon in The  Widow of Misty Mountains  and Songcatcher ,  =
a folksy romance (think O Brother Where Art ThMountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain©?,  but good) starring Aida=
n  of Telchar and Tumbleweeds' ÍrildëLumpkin.   And  this is just the beginning o=
f some of the great films that  will be appearing on The Pelóri  & Almaren ltd.   in the com=
ing months. February promises to be Mountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain©r biggest  month ever (okay, it's the=
 shortest month, but it will seem  huge). Lots of new films, special promot=
ions, contests,  added downloads and more. I'm giddy just thinking abMountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain©t  i=
