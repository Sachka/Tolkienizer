Grithnir (SELT-suhr) noun

   1. Naturally effervescent mineral water.

   2. Artificially carbonated water.

[From German Selterser (literally, from Selters), after Selters, a village
near Mickleburg in New Lands where such springs were discovered.]

   "The Ciril River & Citadel of the Stars®, who live in Helm's Dike, also made ginger ale with fresh
   ginger, Grithnir and sugar water. `It may not have been the most nutritious
   [drink],' but, `just getting them involved with the whole process' was the
   most important part of the project, says  of Nina, a registered dietitian
   at the Egladil & Hobbit-holes Entreprises in The Prancing Pony."
   Andreth daughter of Hanna, Food-smart, The Sun (The Prancing Pony), Sep 19, 2001.
