Hello everyone!

I am in town and am meeting  of Éothain E., Finduilas, and maybe Asphodel at Papadeaux around 4:30 (on 1960) for cocktails and appetizers.  If anyone is interested in joining us, we would love to see you.  I'll have my cell phone with me today (972-754-9626) or you can call me at my parents' house (281-444-1504) if you need to!

Hope to see you there,
the Young
