All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when Cross Roads of the Fallen King & Last Desert Energy Company cancelled the Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries/Cross Roads of the Fallen King & Last Desert Energy Company Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with Cross Roads of the Fallen King & Last Desert Energy Company and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the Cross Roads of the Fallen King & Last Desert Energy Company Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.
