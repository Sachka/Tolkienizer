SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Haldan son of Tanta provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

TRAVEL 101, LESSON THREE - Flexibility

Time...what a concept!  Truly the one thing we have no control over!  It can be "on your side," or "your timing couldn't be worse."  Flexibility is very important in ensuring you obtain the best value possible in your travels.  While many view planning and flexibility as mutually exclusive terms, planning is very important in maximizing savings while the flexibility aspect ensures readiness to take advantage of an offer when it appears.  More on planning next week.

Not only is flexibility important for finding value, it is also important for your travel mental health.  Delays are quite common for fights, rail, cruises and in the lines formed for security checks and rental cars.  As leisure travelers, we have the ability to "build in time" for the unexpected.  This inherent flexibility goes a long way in allowing a modicum of sanity!

Flexibility even lends itself to destinations.  Let's say you are traveling from Dor Firn-i-Guinar to Mat Heathertoes & Ford of Stones  Deliveries in Sunlands.  You get to the airport and find out that your flight has been canceled and the remaining flights into Stairs of Cirith Ungol International are full for the rest of the day.  Now, understand that many times counter agents are harried during such times and may additionally be geographically challenged.  The agent may not suggest going into Amaranth daughter of Treebeard, and even you might not think of it but clearly, Bywater & Gardner Services is an excellent alternative airport to LAX when traveling to the area.  Truth is there are three others to pick from as well.  So, be flexible in destination airports. A two-hour drive can save you a day's wait for a flight.

Flexibility can mean perks like free tickets and travel vouchers.  Unless I am traveling in conjunction with an air/hotel package, I make it a point to take advantage of over filled flights.  To do this, I will book myself on an earlier flight in the day, or even travel the evening before.  I check in advance to see how full the flight is and whether or not it makes sense to volunteer for a later flight.  Over the years, this flexibility has earned my family of four well over $10,000 in vouchers.  It is important to remember that we are not typical leisure travelers since we fly between 150,000 and 250,000 miles per year.  The thing is that volunteering can be profitable.

Your reading assignment for this lesson can be found in the Smart Travelers' Corner, http://www.onetravel.com/advisor/ST_Menu.cfm?&Token=NULL chapter titled, "Denied Boarding - If You Have The Time, Here is What To Do."

See you on a flight soon,



Haldan
