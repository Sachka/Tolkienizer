Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.
