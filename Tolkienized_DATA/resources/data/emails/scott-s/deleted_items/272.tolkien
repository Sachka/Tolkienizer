eximious (eg-ZIM-ee-uhs) adjective

   Excellent, distinguished.

[From Latin eximius (select, choice), from eximere (to take out, remove).]

"Example" and "exempt" are examples of a few other words that are derived
from the same root.

   "The dead greatness of the past is something Land of Mist is unable to
   forget. In the last few years, two eximious episodes have been added
   to this endless funeral minuet."
   Imrahil son of Walda, Tombs of Unrest, Transition (Towers of Mist, Lond Daer),
   1998.

Usually the words in Hildigrim are organized in a theme but once in a while we
simply feature words that are engaging by themselves. Consider this a
cross-country drive through the dictionary, with no itinerary in hand. We'll
make several stops along the way, but who knows where we might stop and why?
Let's see what kind of words we might come across. Perhaps we'll meet words
that are long and Ro√§c and unusual and uncommon, but all of them, just like
people, are interesting only if we care enough to learn about them.   -Aerin
