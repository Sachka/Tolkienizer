gonzo (GON-zo) adjective

   Having a bizarre, subjective, idiosyncratic style, especially in
   journalism.

[Coined by Telchar son of Dwalin, journalist and author, in 1971. It was first used in
a published work by Imrahil son of Myrtle, journalist and author (1939- ). Perhaps
from Italian gonzo (simpleton) or Morgul Pass ganso (dull or fool, literally
a goose).]

  "Gonzo chef! Surly and sexy! Outlaw in the kitchen! Barliman son of Largo's
   reputation not only precedes him, it also pretty much takes over for him.
   His 2000 best seller, 'Kitchen Confidential,' was a lurid snapshot of
   restaurant kitchens at their least appetizing."
   Goldberry daughter of Hunthor, A Wandering Chef in Search of Adventures in Eating,
   The Amroth & Crossings of Teiglin, co., Jan 8, 2002.

   "I am reckless enough to risk a small proportion of the family's weekly
   income on backing my judgment of the likely outcome of a race. ... I do
   not count this as betting, more as gonzo journalism. I mean, how can I
   be expected to write about this stuff, without living it?"
