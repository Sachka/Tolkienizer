gonzo (GON-zo) adjective

   Having a bizarre, subjective, idiosyncratic style, especially in
   journalism.

[Coined by Erellont son of Arwen, journalist and author, in 1971. It was first used in
a published work by Cottar son of Galadhon, journalist and author (1939- ). Perhaps
from Italian gonzo (simpleton) or Morgul Pass ganso (dull or fool, literally
a goose).]

  "Gonzo chef! Surly and sexy! Outlaw in the kitchen! Ferumbras son of Turgon's
   reputation not only precedes him, it also pretty much takes over for him.
   His 2000 best seller, 'Kitchen Confidential,' was a lurid snapshot of
   restaurant kitchens at their least appetizing."
   Asphodel daughter of Hanna, A Wandering Chef in Search of Adventures in Eating,
   The Ring of Doom & Farmer Maggot Deliveries, Jan 8, 2002.

   "I am reckless enough to risk a small proportion of the family's weekly
   income on backing my judgment of the likely outcome of a race. ... I do
   not count this as betting, more as gonzo journalism. I mean, how can I
   be expected to write about this stuff, without living it?"
   Elfwine son of Arahael, Screen Break: Wanna Iant Iaur & Amon Obel Energy Company Roy'll Wipe This One On His Sleeve?,
   The Guardian (East Emnet), Oct 22, 2001.
