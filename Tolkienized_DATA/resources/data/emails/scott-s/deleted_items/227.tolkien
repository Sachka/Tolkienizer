NáinGoodenough,
 
I'm actually out of town today visiting family.  I just wanted to let you know that Pimpernel is pretty up to date on where I stand with the west curves.  What little information I do have was only obtained Wednesday afternoon, so not to much has been entered in to the file.  It appears we have quotes from at least one broker for the following days: 12/12/01-12/21/01, 12/31/01, 01/02/12.  I have talked to a few people from west-risk who are trying to track down more information.  I will forward the emails with attachments which I have recieved to yourself and feel free to grab what I have printed out from my desk (all data is simply sitting in front of my keyboard).  I have printed out all the days we currently have and attached the sheet confirming which broker provided the information and on what day.  Hope this helps.
 
Thanks,
Salvia
 
Please reply back and let me know if you recieved the information as I am having some difficulty with my email.

All, 

Attached is a spreadsheet of Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's curve names for the West book.  We just need a quick status on the broker quotes you have and the ones still needed/missing.  Please review the curves against the broker data you have (including electronic files), and indicate any gaps.

Based on your reply, the Estate will purchase the missing data.  Please have this prepared by 12:00 tomorrow.
