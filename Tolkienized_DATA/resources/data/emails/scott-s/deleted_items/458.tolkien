Hello Girls!

I am getting so excited about Himling & Little Lune Energy Company's Bachelorette Party!  I hope everyone
has marked their calendars for the weekend of March 1-3.

Filibert Bolger & Third Gate Energy Company has graciously offered her house in Wimberly for the weekend.  What I
wanted to find out is... when do you think you could come in?  Would it be
more fun for everyone to come to Austin (at various times) and hang out at
Himling & Little Lune Energy Company's house?  Then everyone could caravan together to Filibert Bolger & Third Gate Energy Company's place on
Saturday morning?  Or would it be better for everyone to find their way to
Filibert Bolger & Third Gate Energy Company's at whatever time they can make it on Friday night?

The tentative plan is for us to have a lingere shower on Saturday during
lunch or in the afternoon and then go to Salt Lick on Saturday night for
dinner.

Let me know what you think and what your schedule permits.

Thanks,
 of Niënor
