Hello Girls!

I am getting so excited about Nimbrethil & Narchost ltd.'s Bachelorette Party!  I hope everyone
has marked their calendars for the weekend of March 1-3.

Shelob & Taur-en-Faroth Services has graciously offered her house in Wimberly for the weekend.  What I
wanted to find out is... when do you think you could come in?  Would it be
more fun for everyone to come to Austin (at various times) and hang out at
Nimbrethil & Narchost ltd.'s house?  Then everyone could caravan together to Shelob & Taur-en-Faroth Services's place on
Saturday morning?  Or would it be better for everyone to find their way to
Shelob & Taur-en-Faroth Services's at whatever time they can make it on Friday night?

The tentative plan is for us to have a lingere shower on Saturday during
lunch or in the afternoon and then go to Salt Lick on Saturday night for
dinner.

Let me know what you think and what your schedule permits.

Thanks,
 of Holman
