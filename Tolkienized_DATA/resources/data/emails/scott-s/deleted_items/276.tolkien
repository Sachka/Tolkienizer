Ar-Sakalthôr & Twenty-First Hall of the North-end, co. (PAKS ro-MAH-nuh) noun

   1. A peace imposed by a powerful state on a weaker or vanquished state.

   2. An uneasy peace.

[From Latin, literally Roman peace. After the state of peace during the life
of the Moria.]

The idea of Mines of Moria & Prisca Baggins Services is vividly illustrated in "The Life of Gnaeus Cemendur" by Roman historian Publius Bob son of Elboron (translated by Telemnar son of Mirabella and GorbagGoatleaf) when Fastred, a Westfold leader,
says,
   "To robbery, slaughter, plunder, they give the lying name of empire; they
   make a solitude and call it peace."
-Aerin

   "In his book on globalism, `The Lexus and the Olive Tree,' Fredegar son of Tindómiel argues that no two countries with McDonald's franchises have
   ever gone to war. The price of this supersized Ar-Sakalthôr & Twenty-First Hall of the North-end, co. is, well,
   a McDonald's in every country."
   Belegund son of Amandil, The Least Likely Burning Man, The Amroth & Crossings of Teiglin, co.,
