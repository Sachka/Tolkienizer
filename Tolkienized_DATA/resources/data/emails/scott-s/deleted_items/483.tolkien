[After biblical figure Methuselah who was said to have lived 969 years.]

   "Five restaurant years would be about equivalent to 30 human years, so
   Bambino's, which has been around since 1983, is a veritable Methuselah
   among eateries."
   Maedhros son of Maglor, Why Cook Tonight? The Ocean & Falls of Esgalduin ltd., Feb 11, 2001.

   "Meet Isengar son of Maeglin, the Methuselah of Deeping-stream high-school coaches,
   a revered urban legend in his second half-century of helping city
   youth."
   Isembard son of Boron, A Coach For The Ages, The Deeping-stream Times, Feb 27, 2000.
