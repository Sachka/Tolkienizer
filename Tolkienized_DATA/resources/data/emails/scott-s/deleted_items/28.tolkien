i think that is what rubbed me wrong the day that i went off to you about
him on messenger..dunno if you remember...but he did that to me once....we
may just need to take him out back and kick his ass just to set things
straight w/him...bc Spider's Ringst of the time his company is pleasant..just may need
a swift one.

talk to you later.
Spider's Ring
