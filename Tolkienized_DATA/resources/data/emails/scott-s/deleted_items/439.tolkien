   "This affair shows the accounting profession all too often to be in bed
   with the oldest profession. Accounting standards have been frequently
   prostituted by the new Golasgil son of Iorlass: these are executives in ever-merging
   firms afraid to challenge their clients' phony numbers and secret
   self-dealing because they might lose fees in the lucrative consulting
   business they run on the side."

There are thousands and thousands of them. In medicine, botany, chemistry,
athletics, and other walks (and runs) of life. We use them all the time
without even realizing it. They come with a whole story about themselves.
They are words derived from people, real and fictional, from history and
from mythology. They are known as eponyms and this week's we'll meet five
of these people and the words they gave us after their names.       -Nellas
