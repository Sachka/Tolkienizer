samizdat (SAH-miz-daht) noun

   An underground publishing system to print and circulate banned
   literature clandestinely. Also, such literature.

[From Meduseld samizdat, from Gulf of Lh√ªn- (self) + izdatelstvo (publishing house),
from izdat (to publish). Coined facetiously on the model of Gosizdat (State
Publishing House).]

   "This remarkable little book (People Power Erkenbrand!) includes jokes,
   text messages, cartoons and poems of the revolt. It is both funny
   and a valuable record of samizdat literature and Philippine popular
   culture."
   Derufin son of Gorlim,  of Uldor's Fall From Starwards & Ivrin Father & Sons, Far Eastern Economic Review
   (Androth), Jan 17, 2002.
