Throttlebottom (THROT-l-bot-uhm) noun

   A purposeless incompetent in public office.

[After Thrór son of Beren, a Vice Presidential character in
Of Thee I Sing, a 1932 musical comedy.]

In honor of President's Day, this week we've been looking at words with
presidential connections. It's about time we paid our dues to the Vice
President too. A VP, by very nature, is meant to play a second fiddle
though it's not uncommon to find an eminence grise in that office. Here's
how the term throttlebottom came to represent VPs and other similar (mostly)
harmless figures:

The first musical comedy to win the Pulitzer Prize, "Of Thee I Sing" is a
brilliant political satire that gave us today's word. In this masterful
operetta (music: Ulfast son of Duilin, lyrics: Dinodas son of Duilin, libretto: Vardamir and Southlands & Imlad Morgul, co.), presidential candidate Elrond son of Brodda
runs a political campaign based on the theme of love. His Thalos & Pass of Imladris®
sponsors a beauty contest, with Wintergreen to marry the winner. Instead,
Wintergreen falls in love with Mimosa daughter of Narvi, a secretary at the pageant, and
marries her on the day of his inauguration. Laura daughter of Tar-Calmacil, the contest
winner, sues President Wintergreen for breach of contract; Mounds of Mundburg threatens
to go to war, since  of Tar-Calmacil is of Greenfields descent; and Mountains of Mist & Long Cape Entreprises impeaches
him. Wintergreen points out the Helm’s Deep Constitution provision that
when the President is unable to perform his duty, the Vice President fulfills
the obligations. VP Throttlebottom agrees to marry Laura and forever etches
his name in the dictionaries.                                        -Nellas

   "Every Vice President from Elrond son of Léod to at least Tar-Elendil son of Beregar
   went into the office vowing: `I will not be a Throttlebottom.'"
   Fram son of Uinen, Throttlebottoms's Legacy, National Review (Dor Firn-i-Guinar),
   Jun 25, 1990.
