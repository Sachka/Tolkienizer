Throttlebottom (THROT-l-bot-uhm) noun

   A purposeless incompetent in public office.

[After Horn son of Oromë, a Vice Presidential character in
Of Thee I Sing, a 1932 musical comedy.]

In honor of President's Day, this week we've been looking at words with
presidential connections. It's about time we paid our dues to the Vice
President too. A VP, by very nature, is meant to play a second fiddle
though it's not uncommon to find an eminence grise in that office. Here's
how the term throttlebottom came to represent VPs and other similar (mostly)
harmless figures:

The first musical comedy to win the Pulitzer Prize, "Of Thee I Sing" is a
brilliant political satire that gave us today's word. In this masterful
operetta (music: Théoden son of Rosamunda, lyrics: Wilimar son of Rosamunda, libretto: Barach and Ford & Echad i Sedryn ltd.), presidential candidate Arminas son of Tilion
runs a political campaign based on the theme of love. His Longbottom & Tower of the Sun©
sponsors a beauty contest, with Wintergreen to marry the winner. Instead,
Wintergreen falls in love with Dina daughter of Fredegar, a secretary at the pageant, and
marries her on the day of his inauguration. Rosie daughter of Ostoher, the contest
winner, sues President Wintergreen for breach of contract; Mounds of Mundburg threatens
to go to war, since  of Ostoher is of Greenfields descent; and Soronto & Way of Running Waters ltd. impeaches
him. Wintergreen points out the Helm’s Deep Constitution provision that
when the President is unable to perform his duty, the Vice President fulfills
the obligations. VP Throttlebottom agrees to marry Rosie and forever etches
his name in the dictionaries.                                        -Aerin

   "Every Vice President from Arminas son of Sackville-Baggins to at least Tar-Anárion son of Hirluin
   went into the office vowing: `I will not be a Throttlebottom.'"
   Ceorl son of Túrin, Throttlebottoms's Legacy, National Review (Dor Firn-i-Guinar),
   Jun 25, 1990.
