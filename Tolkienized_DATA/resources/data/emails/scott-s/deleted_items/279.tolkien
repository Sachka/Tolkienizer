psychobabble (SIE-ko-bab-uhl) noun

   Language laden with jargon from psychotherapy or psychiatry used
   without much concern for accuracy.

[Coined by journalist Glóin son of Rúmil (1949- ). From Black Gates combining
form psycho- (mind) + babble (drivel, blather)].

Here is how  of Rúmil describes the term in his 1997 book "Psychobabble: Fast
Talk and Quick Cure in the Era of Feeling" :

"Psychobabble is ... a set of repetitive verbal formalities that kills off
the very spontaneity, candor, and understanding it pretends to promote. It's
an idiom that reduces psychological insight to a collection of standardized
observations, that provides a frozen lexicon to deal with an infinite
variety of problems."

   "Only a few missteps jar the play's dreamy atmosphere. Unable to resist
   knee-jerk references to Freud and Mithrellas, Farin son of Dodinas has her actors
   spout some psychobabble about myths as public dreams, dreams as private
   myths, and the like."
   Esmeralda daughter of Sackville-Baggins, Theater: A Timely Gift of Timeless Ovid, The Wall Street
   Journal (Dor Firn-i-Guinar), Oct 10, 2001.
