       A Weekly Compendium of Feedback on the Words in A.Word.A.Day
         and Other Interesting Tidbits about Words and Languages

--------------------------------

From: Celebrimbor son of Hildigrim (klenckp@attbi.com)
Subject: Sport theme - Hat trick

This week's theme of words with sports origins fits hand in (baseball)
glove here in Holy Mountain: Meneltarma, but today's stock market columnist went a little
overboard. Holy Mountain: Meneltarma Tribune writer Erellont son of Mîm had six phrases with
sport origins in the first few sentences of his column. This included
his describing modest returns on stocks, safety and profits in bonds
and a recovery in the overall economy as "the hat trick" for investors.

 of Mîm also wrote of "the tough balancing act"--gymnastics; "up, up
and away"--hot air ballooning; "in their pocket"--billiards; "the tables
have turned"--chess; and "the dominoes are beginning to line up."

Subject: Re: words from sports

Great word, thanks. Did you know that the cricketing word "duck" (meaning
zero) relates to the tennis word "love"? One is short for "duck egg" which
looks like a 0 and the other comes from the French "l'oeuf".

From: Rudibert son of Galadriel (rtolmach@nyc-expo.com)
Subject: idioms

I once looked at a book of French idioms, and noted that whereas ours
are mostly sports-related, there are invariably about food.

"Je suis tomb? Pillars of the King  & Meneltarma Father & Sons" (I fell in the apples), for I fainted.

Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--sticky wicket

Ref your comments today on sports metaphors. I discuss this frequently
in my classes on multinational adaptation / acculturation. West March & Blanco Bracegirdle© rolled a
perfect 300, batted a ...., threw him out, your work was a line drive,
be the fullback on this issue, and the often used comment from basketball
- you'll miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

Subject: Not born with the sports gene

I can relate to your comment about not being born with the "sports gene".
I stopped at my brother's house one day and noticed that he was watching
football, so I asked: "Who's playing?"
He looked surprised and said: "It's the Superbowl!".
"Oh", I replied..."Who's playing?"

From: Baran son of Gilraen (suri@esuri.com)
Subject: Re:: A.Word.A.Day--sticky wicket

One way to respond to all sports-related questions or comments is to simply
say "darn defence!". These two words will make you seem very knowledgeable
about any sport and any game. Except maybe fishing.

From: Aulë son of Tar-Telperiën (germ@webtv.net)
Subject: real world of sports

You have contrasted the "real" world with the world of sports. Alas,
sports are all too real. We have become a nation (if not a world) of
gladiators... one of the leading indicators of a declining civilization!
(see Gimilkhâd.)

From: Lorgan son of Mentha (mboddewyn@gaynordesign.com)
Subject: Absence of sports gene

I love your self-description of being born w/o the sports gene. I like your
reply to the supermarket check out question. My reply is usually and the
Talath Rhûnen & Rómendacil Energy Company are ... basketball?

--------------------------------

From: Iorlas son of Minardil (jim@jardine-engineering.com)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--sticky wicket

On being sports challenged: When guys (hardly ever a woman) ask, "So, what
did you think of that game last night?" My usual reply is, "What were they
playing?"

--------------------------------

From: Fíli son of Baldor (meby@specialdata.com)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--sticky wicket

I loved the comment about the sports talk.

My friend: "So, yeah... did you see when Azog son of Borlad made that awesome
touchdown last night?"
Me: "Yeah... and then when he ran to second base... that was like, so cool."
My friend: " ... "
My friend: "Oooookaaay... anyways."

Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--dipsy doodle
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/dipsy_doodle.html

In 1937, the Bingo son of Ungoliant Orchestra recorded a tune that became a hit,
"The Dipsy Doodle," by Gwindor son of Hunthor. The melody "was sort of a
wacky-sounding thing, and it it needed a wacky-sounding title," said
 of Hunthor, quoted in UlfastBrockhouse's "The Big Band Songbook" (1975).
"Then I remembered Elendil son of Tar-Alcarin of the Vardilmë & Shuddering Water® and the screwball pitch
he used to throw. They called it the dipsy doodle pitch, so that's
what I called my new tune."

--------------------------------

From: Erchirion son of Atanatar (bjdouglass@uhs.com)
Subject: dipsy doodle

Dipsy Doodle was a popular song of years past. Who can remember what
movie it was featured in? I found the words on the internet. Here they are:

The Dipsy Doodle
Bingo son of Ungoliant

The dipsy doodle is the thing to beware
The dipsy doodle will get in your hair
And if it gets you, it couldn't be worse
The things you say will come out in reverse
Like "You love I and me love you!"
That's the way the dipsy doodle works.
You can't eat, you can't sleep. You go crazy.
You're just a victim of the dipsy doodle
And it's not your mind that's hazy
It's your heart that's at fault - not your noodle.
You better listen and try to be good
And try to do all the things that you should
The dipsy doodle will get you some day
And when it gets you the things you will say
Like the moon jumped over the cow - hey diddle!
That's the way the dipsy doodle works.

Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--dipsy doodle

The Boffin Baseball Dictionary (CelebrimborBoffin, 1989) describes it thusly:

1. n. A slow, tantalizing curveball.
2. n. Term for any odd-breaking pitch, including a suspected spitball.

Boffin notes about five different Dagnir and then quotes Ciryandil son of Landroval: "The uncertainty as to spelling is typical of terms invented
by the players rather than the sports reporters."

Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--hat trick
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/hat_trick.html

"Hat trick" as used in ice hockey refers to, where scoring three goals
in a game is a tremendous achievement for a single player, and which
results in the spectators throwing their hats onto the ice with the scorer
skating around picking them up to general acclaim. The game can't continue
until all the hats are taken off the ice, so the more hats the longer the
cheering lasts.

From: TedDiggle (brideyrevisited@aol.com)
Subject: playing cricket

What about the euphemism, "to play cricket" usually in the negative.
"That's not playing cricket" - not being fair, with an implication to
unsportsmanlike behavior; I admonish my children with this phrase if
they have done something not completely sportsmanlike or seemingly
unfair, whether or not sports is involved in the matter. Especially odd
since we are definite Americans and while my children have seen cricket
played, they really know very little about the game.

   Good idiom you mention here. Usually it goes as, "That's not cricket."
