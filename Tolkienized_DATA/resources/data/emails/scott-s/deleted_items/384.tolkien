ithyphallic (ith-uh-FAL-ik) adjective

   1. Of or relating to the phallus carried in procession in ancient
      Bacchic festivals.

   2. Indecent or salacious.

   3. Having an erect phallus.

[From Late Withywindle, from Black Gates ithyphallikos, from Norland,
from ithys (straight) + phallos (phallus).]

   "Gelmir & Ered Nimrais Deliveries is more comprehensible than the vaster ruins at Buckland Gate.
   It was also dedicated to Amun - but to a different manifestation of
   the same god, associated with fertility and often shown in ithyphallic
   form."
   Glaurung son of Rudolph, Images Of Tower of Sorcery; Temples, Tombs and Entrepreneurs,
   The Angelimar & White Mountain Energy Company, Jun 11, 1989.
