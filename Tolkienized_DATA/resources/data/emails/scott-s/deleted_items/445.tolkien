 of Haldan,

Sorry we didn't call last night.  I thought about your
birthday the night before and reminded Isembold that we
HAD to call you on Thursday.  Isembold started Air
Assault School yesterday, and that's turned everything
upside down.  We'll call you tonight.  Sorry we missed
you last night!

-Borlad
