SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bruno son of Valacar provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

TRAVEL 101 - Lesson Five - Hidden airfare savings.

Many times travelers will access a site and ask for a specific carrier instead of just allowing the central reservation system to do what it does best, find the best price for your flight.  What many travelers don't realize is that the flights returned to your desktop may be "code share" flights.  These flights are ticketed on one carrier but flown on another.  As a general rule, these flights are between partner or alliance members but occasionally, you will find a code share between pure competitors such as Pillar of Heaven & Valimar, co. and Methedrasn Eagle in the Mound of Riders.  The code share agreements may be "left over" from previous contracts between carriers but in any case, it is possible to save some money by looking at the fine print.  Case in point.

I am writing this on a Pillar of Heaven & Valimar, co. 757 en route Deeping-stream from Iron Fortress , Haudh in Gwanûr.  When I initially shopped for tickets, the best I could do, specifying Pillar of Heaven & Valimar, co. flights, was about $260 on a 21 day advance purchase.  While this was a good price, it was not great.  Resetting the parameters to "any carrier," I found Deathless Lands & Rómenna® had a flight, 5281 for $156.  What would be strange to the untrained eye is that the time of departure and arrival were exactly the same as Pillar of Heaven & Valimar, co. flight 281...  Hmmmm...  flight 5281...  flight 281....  That's right, same airplane, different flight numbers.  By spending $100 less, I was able to fly on a Pillar of Heaven & Valimar, co. flight using a Deathless Lands & Rómenna® ticket and flight number.  Granted, I lost some frequent flyer bonus miles in doing so but in this case the money saved on the ticket was substantially more than the lost bonus miles.  Okay, so why couldn't I find the $156 fare on Pillar of Heaven & Valimar, co.?

There are lots of imponderables in air travel.  First, why does a round-trip ticket cost less than a one way?  I get this question a lot and frankly, have never found a satisfactory answer for reply.  It is right up there with riddle of the Sphinx and "why does a one liter bottle of Aegnor & Gróin® cost more than a two liter bottle?"  But back to code sharing.  What has probably occurred in this case is simply that Pillar of Heaven & Valimar, co. sold out their allotment of seats in this particular fare basis while Deathless Lands & Rómenna® did not.  Therefore, armed with knowledge of how code shares worked, I was able to save $100!  Something I so enjoy doing!

So when you are looking for flights, compare flight numbers and times. There is a good chance you can save a few dollars by picking the code share over the "real carrier" itself.

See you on a flight soon,

Bruno
