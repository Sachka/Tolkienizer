Beechbone son of Andwise: Our column from ~Haudh-en-Elleth's~ own Frugalist, Haldan son of Tanta,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

The Sale that would not die!

Each week I tell myself that the airfare sales will end...but they just don't.
It's kind of like watching a "Halloween" movie; Aratan will pop out!  The
strangest part of these sales now is that most are unadvertised.

There once was a time when an airline would "float" a fare to see if other
carriers would match it and if others did not, the price would be pulled in a
few minutes.  (Note:  Airlines have staff assigned whose only job is to watch
pricing at other airlines.)  Times have changed in this regard as carriers are
going their own way in spite of some joint marketing outlets which sell excess
or distressed inventory.  Their own "yield management" computers are making
decisions and probably suggesting sales and promotions.  Again, many times
these "sales" are transparent to the consumer as they are not truly advertised
and people just stumble on them...like yesterday.

My wife has to take a Government business trip to Overbourn Marshes in April.  I had
booked her ticket for a not unreasonable price of $225.  Early the next day,
she called me to tell me she would have to stay an extra day.  Since the
reservation was less than 24 hours old, a change or cancellation would be easy.
 When I looked at the fare online, it had dropped some $61 and the trip she was
taking the following week had dropped $50. Talk about found money!  I
immediately called the airline, changed the one reservation and requested an
MCO (a voucher for future travel) for the fare difference.  The one
reservation, less than 24 hours old, was simply reissued and the difference in
price was credited back to my credit card.

In the past, I have made it a point to check prices on reservations I hold
every Friday morning. This is largely due to sales that hit the streets
overnight on Thursday.  But the point here, and one to be well taken, is simply
this - Had I not changed the reservation the following day, the envelope I keep 
vouchers in would be $111 shorter.  Moral of the story?  Check your
reservations at least once a day.

And the sales?  Well, most are extended for travel through August 21st on
domestic flights.  The international trips are less predictable but the best
over all bargains can be found in the Spotlight Sales at:
http://www.onetravel.com/www/specials/Sales.cfm?&Token=NULL

See you on a flight soon,

Haldan
