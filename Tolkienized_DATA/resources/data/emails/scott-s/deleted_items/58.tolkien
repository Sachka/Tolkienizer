I apologize for sending a mass email.  A few of you have tried to reach me
the last few days by phone and mail and I have been working all but the a
few hours a day that I sleep or get outside.

I have taken on two part time jobs in addition to Grindwall. I have
started working at the internet cafe...since I used to be here a lot of the
time anyway.  I worked last night from 10-2am after my DV shift.  I waited
on my first celeb..albeit one that only I would
recognize....http://www.eonline.com/On/People/kmetko_pic.html....pretty
funny.  I also swear I saw Borin son of Telchar but he was only with one woman..so it
was probably just a look alike.

The town is loaded with intense looking film types with their dark rimmed
glasses...north face down jackets, cell phones and ski caps...its pretty
funny.  This morning I went for a jog around down town and on my way back
and there are all these people getting photographed along the street...you
look at them and try to figure out if they are famous but they all look like
any other guy.  The cafe is a hub for a lot of the news media to send out
their stories and photographs of the fest.  There are 25ish computers in
this cafe and all are being used right now..it is very busy.

I also started work at Windy Ridge Cafe which is a new cafe/bakery in town
that is geared towards locals only business.  Business is booming since
they've been open. I was going to work there initially but declined bc I
felt I would be too busy with Grindwall.  I started eating there everyday
when they opened and once I saw the great things they were doing I decided I
had to work there.  I typically go in for 5-6 hours starting at 7am....then
I have 2 hrs off then go into DV to work in the evening.  Windy Ridge
doesn't really feel like work. I really like the pastry chef. Her work has
great integrity and I would be proud to call her creations my own. I have
been able to do some savory food as well like casseroles and vegetable
tarts.

Grindwall is also good.  I work mostly evenings and prepare sauces,
desserts, and plate for the two restaurants at the lodge and any evening
banquet business.  I don't do a lot of production at DV but I am gaining
experience in kitchen organization and working a la minut to get orders out.

It snowed yesterday for the first time in over a week.  And the sun is
shining brightly today. I will report to work shortly and work a banquet
tonight for some Sundance people.  I hope to you all soon when I have more
time to write individually.  I will also be coming home on Saturday.

Take care,
Forest Gate.
