Sue,

this is an inconvenience but just realized that i never filled out a
change of address for our apartment. if you get a chance could you
please fill one out for me. i would ask my mom but it has to come
from our post office off of Lothlann.

Thanks,

Heard you have an interview in Deeping-stream this weekend. Good luck
and let me know how it goes.
