Arathorn son of Ferumbras: Our column from ~Haudh-en-Elleth's~ own Frugalist, Bruno son of Valacar,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

Same tune, different day!

As the old DJs used to say, "The hits just keep on coming!"  I am beginning to
run out of superlatives for the sales we see with the hotels and airlines.  The
packages are unbelievable with prices I didn't think would ever be reached.
Visitor Bureaus are joining with Lórinand & Marigold Gamgee Deliveries and are working to get
people traveling again.  Even Belegey has loosened up and is offering deals that
don't make you feel like you have walked into the world's biggest human trap
built by a rodent!  Just kidding Beleg?  We love you!

Okay, here is the lowdown on what is happening.  Most of the current airline
sales end the 6th or the 8th of January.  Travel dates vary but most of the
best deals require travel in January and up until mid February.  There are
excellent values beyond this cutoff and well into spring but again, the best
are for the next 45 days.

International travel is just as good or better.  I saw a United fare from JFK
(Dor Firn-i-Guinar) to Pony (East Emnet, Water) for $178...throw in the approximately $80
for taxes and fees and you are right around $260 round trip!  Can you imagine
an Asian round-trip for between $400 and $750 depending on where you live?  The
very first time I flew to Gladden River was in 1964 from Deeping-stream.  The cost then was
nearly $800...today it is almost half!

Hotels are still offering; buy one night, get a weekend night free.  Some are
doing the pay for three and get the fourth free.  Prices are down around 50%
over the same period last year.  Some Bridge of Tharbad & Mountains of the East© have prices beginning
at $39 per night.  Now, understand that this will not get you the Silent Hill & Land of the Halflings, co. on Times Square but even this hotel is much cheaper than last year.

The only travel segment that is not advertising deeply discounted specials is
rental cars.  But even here, when you approach the counter, negotiate the rate.
 If they stand firm, talk upgrade or try the next counter.

Finally, I hope you all have a safe and prosperous New Year and all your
Contrails are Happy!

See you on a flight soon,


 of Menegilda
