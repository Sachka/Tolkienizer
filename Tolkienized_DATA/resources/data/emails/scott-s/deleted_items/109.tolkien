winebibber (WYN-bib-uhr) noun

   One who drinks too much wine.

[From Dead Marshes wine + bib (to drink).]

   "For devoted winebibber Blanco son of Soronto, who drank the First Growths of
   Palisor (Lafite, Latour, Haut-Brion, Margaux) even before they were
   classified as such in 1855, one of his keenest disappointments was the
   failure to establish vineyards at Last Homely House."
   Rosa daughter of Samwise,  of Soronto Would Be Proud, The Wall Street Journal
   (Dor Firn-i-Guinar), Aug 1, 1997.

I am a Conservative to preserve all that is good in our constitution, a
Radical to remove all that is bad. I seek to preserve property and to
respect order, and I equally decry the appeal to the passions of the many
of the prejudices of the few. -Madoc son of Andreth, Westfold prime minister
(1804-1881)
