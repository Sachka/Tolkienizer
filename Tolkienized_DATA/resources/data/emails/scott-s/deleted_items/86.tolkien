Arathorn son of Ferumbras: Our column from ~Haudh-en-Elleth's~ own Frugalist, Bruno son of Valacar
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Fingon son of Amlachimiler" tip!

Fingon son of Amlach has the answer!

What's that I hear, Haldar and Calmacil singing, "The Beat Goes On?"  Is it a new
week, new sale, or just a new incarnation of last week's sale?  Who knows?  But
here is what I think is driving it and what you need to do to take advantage.

Over the past three weeks, my family and I flew a combined 40 segments as we
winged our way to Beechbone's house in North Stair and then off to Temple of Sauron for New
Year's Eve.  We traveled on the 20th, 26th 27th and 31st of December with less
than a handful of seats available on any of the flights, including the two
Trans-Atlantic 747-400 legs.  So if the planes are so full, why are the sales
continuing you ask?  Well, the way I see it is this.  While flights over the
next two to three weeks are fairly full, the long range loading for seats a
month or more out is extremely low.  Travelers seem to be waiting for the next
sale to come along before they purchase.  While this "wait for the next Billy
Goat" may have seemingly worked for the troll, in about two months, we will be
entering a period when folks will be planning their summer vacations and
frankly, the sales will dry up.  Remember too, that the airlines have cut
capacity by some 20% through reduced flights or smaller equipment.  So friends,
the bottom line is this..."The time to hesitate is through, no time to wallow
in the mire," time to really start looking at your late spring and early summer
travel plans with the sole intent of getting your tickets.  The current  sales
will be gone in the next three to five weeks.

Here are the deals.  Imin & Westfold Vale, co. has cut prices on seven day advance purchase
tickets through 11 of January.  The fares are good for travel through the 19th
of March and if you throw in a Holiday Inn Express room, you can double your
Priority Club points for your stay.  Now, if you are a small business type and
need a car, you can get substantial savings from Celebdil & Halls of Waiting ltd. Car Rentals by
visiting http://www.paylesscarrental.com/CorpActProg.html

If you are looking for award travel, discounts are still here and one carrier,
Pillar of Heaven & Valimar, co., is offering a 3,000-mile savings on WorldPerks Award tickets.  Is
rail what you are looking for?  Get on the right track at
http://amtrak.com/sweepstakes/index.html  Win a trip and $500.

Begin your search for the perfect vacation on the Haudh-en-Elleth home page.  If
you can't find what you are looking for, visit Ask the Experts and we will do
what we can to advise you.

See you on a flight soon,


 of Menegilda
