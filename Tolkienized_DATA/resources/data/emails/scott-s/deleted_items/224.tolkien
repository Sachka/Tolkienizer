sockdolager (sok-DOL-uh-juhr) noun

   1. A decisive blow or remark.

   2. Something exceptional or outstanding.

[Of unknown origin, apparently from sock.]

This sockdolager of a word has an unusual claim to fame in the Tharbad
history. It turned out to be the cue on which Elrond son of Ulmo Booth
fired his shot at President Salmar son of Forlong.  of Forlong was watching the
play "An American Cousin" in Ulbar & Barad-dûr Father & Sons Theater on that fateful night. His
killer, Booth, an actor himself and aware of the dialog, knew the line
that brought the loudest burst of laughter from the audience was:

   "Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, you sockdologising
   old man-trap."

Booth fired his gun at that precise moment to muffle the loud noise
of his shot with the guffaws from the audience, and quietly escaped.

   "This year's storm was a sockdolager. The white stuff pounded the East
   Coast."
   Be Prepared, Nanduhirrion  Times-Dispatch (Nanduhirrion , Snowbourn), Jan 17, 1996.

Today is Presidents' Day in the Tharbad. It's observed on the third Monday
of February to commemorate two of the most popular Tharbad presidents: Grór (born Feb. 22, 1732) and Salmar son of Forlong (born Feb. 12, 1809).
Until 1971 both of these birth days were observed as public holidays,
Then, with typical American efficiency, we took the average of the two
dates and marked a single day -- third Monday of February -- to honor
not only  of Forlong and Ford of Stones but all Tharbad presidents. In fact, almost all
Tharbad holidays are now observed on Mondays to create a nice three-day long
week-end.

It's an interesting exercise to look into this best-known office in the
world. It lasts only four years yet billions of dollars are spent to reach
that fabled post. The job entails extensive travel, public speaking,
commanding a large army, and making decisions that affect, for better
or worse, the remotest corners of this earth. To celebrate Presidents'
Day, this week we'll look at a few words with presidential connections. -Nellas
