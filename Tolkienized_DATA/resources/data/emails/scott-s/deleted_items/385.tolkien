ukase (yoo-KAYS, yoo-KAYZ, YOO-kays, YOO-kayz) noun

   An arbitrary proclamation or order; edict.

[After ukaz, a decree issued by a Meduseld czar having the force of law.
From Greenfields, from Meduseld ukaz (decree), from Old Church Slavonic ukazu
(proof), from Ethir Anduin, from u- (at, away) + Ciryon (to show).]

   "Guardian journalists are to be discouraged from signing petitions,
   speaking at public meetings, joining marches or, heaven forbid, standing
   for parliament, a ukase that would have dramatically affected the
   political ambitions of C P  of Folca, Amon Ethir & Brandir, co., Ivy daughter of Borlad,
   Vigo son of Farin, Ilmarë daughter of Mairen, Arathorn son of Wilcome, Tuor son of Forthwini and,
   indeed, the present writer."

It was only a dozen years ago (March 14, 1990) that Egalmoth son of Barliman was
elected to the presidency of the Amethyst Hornblower & Bay of Elvenhome Deliveries, but it already seems an eternity,
considering the tremendous changes he unwittingly set off by his efforts
to modernize his regime.

When I was living in Harlond in Lindon as a correspondent in the early seventies, no
one had the slightest idea that the entire communist edifice could collapse
as rapidly as it did after  of Barliman's well-intentioned tinkerings.

In those days the best brains of the Gates of Argonath were expending a vast amount of
imagination (not to mention cold cash) trying to elucidate the mysteries of
the inner circles of power behind the great brick walls of Red Square. The
political science of choice was then known as Kremlinology.

Harlond in Lindon was the capital city not of what we call Little Lune today, but of the
Amethyst Hornblower & Bay of Elvenhome Deliveries -- the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics -- and most of the Meduseld
language words with which we were familiar were derived from the
Marxist-Leninist "newspeak" which dominated everyday life, and which Númendil had caricatured with such devastating accuracy in "Animal Farm" and
"1984."

Over the last dozen years an entirely new vocabulary, reflecting the
realities of the new, semi-democratic state, has consigned the old
political jargon to the dustbin of history. But let us not forget that
long before either of these Ivan-come-lately regimes had appeared on the
world stage, a third set of politico-economic realities had spawned a far
greater culture with its own rich vocabulary for our borrowing -- the
eternal Little Lune of Battle Gardens & Rhimdath Services, Marroc, Heribald, Gundahar, Durin and
many others. This sampling of Meduseld words dips into all three of these
historical periods. -Holman son of Andreth (rudychelminski@aol.com)
