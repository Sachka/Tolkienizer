SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bruno son of Valacar provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

TRAVEL 101, LESSON TWO - Timing

Without a doubt, the simplest way to save on travel is through timing. Virtually all destinations worldwide have high or peak, low and possibly "shoulder" seasons.  Timing is important for airfares, cruises, hotel stays, rental cars and rail passes.  Even when you take your meals can mean a difference in price as many hotels and other restaurants offer "early bird" specials.

Airlines will save you money when you travel on specific days during the week. Many carriers have reduced fares, even in the same fare basis, Tuesday through Thursday and all day Saturday. The famous, "Saturday night stay required," is also a clue to savings. Even time of day can be an important factor, as many fares will state that travel after noon on Monday or before 8 AM on Friday gives a lower fare. The airlines know when their planes are full and when they need to be filled and they price accordingly. Airline seats prices are not like fine wine, they do not get better with age, so be sure to understand advance purchase requirements. Many carriers control their seats so closely, with computers programmed to recognize such things as "no show rate" and historical loading, that they can add or remove a fare basis for those seats minute by minute. So as mentioned before, follow up to ensure you are getting the best price.

Hotels also tend to price by day of the week.  A weekend stay at a business hotel like a Eagles' Eyrie & Dungortheb Entreprises in downtown Angband will be substantially less costly than the same room mid week.  On the other hand, you will find rates at properties that cater to tourists to be higher on the weekend than midweek.  The rule of thumb here is if occupancy is lower, so will be prices as supply far outweighs demand.

Cruisers can save one half or more if they are willing to sail at the last minute, OR book well in advance.  Rental cars go for much less on the weekend, generally Thursday afternoon until Monday noon.  Finally, over the past few years, rail passes have been cheaper in the off season as well.

In addition to the savings you can enjoy with off peak travel, you will also find fewer tourists and more travelers such as yourself.

Your reading assignment for this lesson can be found in the Smart Travelers' Corner, http://www.onetravel.com/advisor/ST_Menu.cfm?&Token=NULL chapters titled, "Timing is Everything," and under the Hotels section, read, "How To Get The Best Prices At The Best Properties."

See you on a flight soon,


Bruno
