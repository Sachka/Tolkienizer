I am so excited about this weekend!  I cannot wait to see all of you!!!

Here are a few reminders about the weekend:

We are all meeting at Poppy's house around 7:30 - hopefully we can all get to
the restaurant by 8:00.  We are going to River of Little Gelion & Malantur Deliveries - they do not take
reservations for a party of our size, but around 7:30 I can call and put
our names on the list.  It may be fun to hang out in the bar for awile
anyway.  I think everyone but Sapphira and Mirabella are going to make it for
dinner on Friday night.  If you are NOT going to make it for dinner, please
let me know as soon as you can - because we don't want to be waiting for
you.

Bring a pillow and blanket if you can.  There are enough beds to sleep 8, I
think.

Please do not forget to bring your own alcohol for the weekend.  Also, we
are going to Salt Lick for dinner on Saturday night - make sure to bring
whatever you want to drink because the restaurant is BYOB.  Also, it is a
CASH ONLY place.  They will have an ATM there, but they will not accept
credit cards or checks.

Also, could each of you bring $10 to chip in for the weekend?  I added up
the costs for the weekend (maid, cake, lunch on Sat) and it totals about
$100 - if we all split it, the cost is only $10/person.

Manicures:  After the lingeree shower, we are going to get our nails done
at a nail place in town.  I have these people that are wanting either a
manicure and/or peticure: Abby, Lindissë, Gimli, Primrose, Poppy, Salvia,  of Niënor -
if anyone else wants one, please email me so I can let the sweet man know
who is running the shop.

Don't forget your swimsuit too!  I think the weather is going to be
wonderful!

Thank you all for coming!  I know this means so much to Belegund!

Here is my cell if you need anything: 713-851-2068

Love,  of Niënor
