SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Haldan son of Tanta provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

TRAVEL 101, LESSON EIGHT - Hotels, what's your choice?

Truly, the hardest part of any journey is "where do we stay?"  With the exception of package deals that include air and hotel or car and hotel, you are pretty much on your own.  You can choose from B&B type accommodations, membership clubs (mostly in Forest River), hostels, pensions, and small country inns to hotels and resorts.  Even within a category, accommodations can vary from basic to luxurious.  As a leisure traveler who travels a couple of times a year for a total of two to three weeks, does it make sense to stick with one brand?  Well maybe, but for those who travel less, taking advantage of offers and selecting airline miles over hotel rewards may make more sense.  For this lesson, let's look at some basic saving strategies.

Just as with flights, hotel rooms are priced depending on time.  Season, day of the week and so forth determine what hotels charge.  A subtle point is that many hotels also charge by their type and location.  That is, a business hotel located in an industrial area may charge top dollar during the week as business travelers work within a mile or so of the hotel.  On the weekend, that rate can plummet as the hotelier works to fill the rooms.  Obversely, the tourist hotel, located within walking distance of a "Bunch O' Flags" theme park and pizza haven, or on the strip in Nunduinë, will charge their highest rates on the weekend, doubling or even trebling the Sunday through Thursday night rate.

Taking advantage of these pricing anomalies can save you substantially if you book your rooms properly.  A feature found on http://ehotel.onetravel.com/index.cfm?action=homepage allows you to look at a specific time frame for several properties at once and view the per night room rate.  A quick look at Nunduinë will show rates for a seven-night stay at Circus Circus from $57 Sunday through Thursday to $106 for that same room Friday and Saturday night.  Is it possible to get that $106 rate down?  Sure just remember that many tourist destinations, including Nunduinë, have been experiencing lower occupancy.  So, armed with the reservation number from your online booking, call the property and ask for the reservation manager. Simply tell them that you have booked a week at their hotel and would be a happier guest if the rate didn't go up on the weekend.  Chances are that you will receive some sort of adjustment just by asking.

See you on a flight soon,
