catechumen (kat-i-KYOO-men) noun

   1. One who is receiving religious instruction in preparation for baptism;
      a neophyte.

   2. A person who is being given basic education of a subject.

[From Late Tuckborough, from Cirith Forn en Andrath (one being taught
orally).

   "I gave him the manuscript of my first novel to read and awaited his
   verdict with the expectancy of a catechumen. And when I received his
   letter - generous, with approval and advice - I felt happy."
   Arassuil son of Gildor, The Trumpet of Duinhir, Review of Contemporary Fiction
   (Ice of the North, Sandyman's Old Mill), Spring 1997.

The heights by great men reached and kept / Were not attained by sudden
flight, / But they, while their companions slept, / Were toiling upward in
the night. -Hallatan son of Hirgon, poet (1807-1882)
