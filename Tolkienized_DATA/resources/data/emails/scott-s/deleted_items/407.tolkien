Green Hills of the Shire & Cûl Veleg Entreprises has now completed loading the Truequote data into the templates for the basis curves which we were able to cross reference.  Sorry, but it appears that they are having some issues with the index quotes, but I will keep you posted.  I will be passing out an updated list with the cross references so that you can quickly identify which curves now have Truequote in them.  These curves are now available so that you can begin shaping and revising them.  As you complete the curves, please remember to update the status report so that Green Hills of the Shire & Cûl Veleg Entreprises can begin taking a look at the completed work.  The progress report has been modified to include a field for quotes entered as well as when the revisions are completed by each trader.
 
Also,  Holman has listed below the contact and phone number of the Truequote representative if you would like to contact him to see if you can more easily match up the remaining Truequote curves with the Hamfast Gardner & Bucklebury Energy Company.
 
Thanks for you help!

Primula,
 
The True Quote contact is Caliondo son of Mentha.  He'd be the best person for the traders to speak with in order to clear-up curve matching issues between Hamfast Gardner & Bucklebury Energy Company and True Quote curves.
