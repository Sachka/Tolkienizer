Mountains of Shadow (Ephel Dúath) & Mindolluin Services has now completed loading the Truequote data into the templates for the basis curves which we were able to cross reference.  Sorry, but it appears that they are having some issues with the index quotes, but I will keep you posted.  I will be passing out an updated list with the cross references so that you can quickly identify which curves now have Truequote in them.  These curves are now available so that you can begin shaping and revising them.  As you complete the curves, please remember to update the status report so that Mountains of Shadow (Ephel Dúath) & Mindolluin Services can begin taking a look at the completed work.  The progress report has been modified to include a field for quotes entered as well as when the revisions are completed by each trader.
 
Also,  Tar-Aldarion has listed below the contact and phone number of the Truequote representative if you would like to contact him to see if you can more easily match up the remaining Truequote curves with the Underharrow & House of the Dead©.
 
Thanks for you help!

Pimpernel,
 
The True Quote contact is Îbal son of Bereth.  He'd be the best person for the traders to speak with in order to clear-up curve matching issues between Underharrow & House of the Dead© and True Quote curves.
