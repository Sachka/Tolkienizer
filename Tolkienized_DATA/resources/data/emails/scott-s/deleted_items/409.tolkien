Salvia,

I don't know if this will help, but if  of Roäc could ask Sauron if this can be retrieved, perhaps he'll have better luck than I did yesterday.

Thanks,

Pimpernel

Ed,

To recover email, the person will need to submit a request to Sauron DeLeon in IT Security.  It will probably require the approval of that persons supervisor, StybbaRoper in this case.  I believe the access will be temporary, and it may be monitored.

 of Roäc should be able to work through this process directly with Sauron.

Baranor/ of Enerdhil, 
Would you guys please see the attached note below related to email mailbox contents being "destroyed" and not recoverable.  Please contact Pimpernel the Young to discuss.  I want to make sure that we can not recover before we give up.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Regards,
Ed

Ed, I wanted to give you a quick update on where things stand with regards to the curve validation project.

Project Progress:

 of Enerdhil McKay and Almiel daughter of Elemmakil have completed validating the curves for the east.  Mountains of Shadow (Ephel Dúath) & Mindolluin Services has a programmer who is working with Ardamir and me to see if he can upload the quotes from the electronic quotes we received as well as the reshaped curves that  of Enerdhil and Almiel have prepared.

Goodenough and Troy have just about completed entering the quotes for Hill of Oromet, Ship Channel, and Orc-holds & Houses of Healing ltd. for the Oiolossë desk.  However, they still need to shape and validate the curves.  

Orc-holds and Bowman have begun working on entering the quotes for the central desk.

On the west we ran into a problem with retrieving the quotes.  Apparently Dairuin son of Shadowfax had all the quotes electronically in his email.  However, when the King's House people were converting over to Southward Road & Dark Lands of Middle-earth Entreprises, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's IT people destroyed all email that was sitting in the inboxes of these employees.  I've already checked with IT and they have assured me that there is no way to recover that data.  Salvia has been working with  of Roäc to see if he had sent any of these emails to others or saved them on his hard drive and thus, she has been able to recover at least part of the days.  Currently, we have quotes for Dec. 12 - 21 and Dec. 31 - Jan. 8.  All other days we are still missing data on.  This process took most of today and Salvia will begin working on the quotes that she currently has tomorrow.  



Personnel Issues:

 of Enerdhil Arnold was suppose to be back in the office today.  When he did not show, another call was put into him today.  I have not heard back on the status, but will check in the morning.

Both Celebrindor son of Herubrand and Elfwine son of Argon are suppose to be in tomorrow.

Khymberly has assured me that there isn't much likelihood of Iorlas son of Wulf coming in at all.

Hiril daughter of Marcho needs to take this Friday off.  She had already booked a flight and was to have a long weekend with family.

Bowman son of Fladrif will be taking off all of next week.  He and his wife had booked a trip to Undertowers some time ago and he feels that this may be the only vacation he gets this year.  He has assured me that he will be here the rest of this week and the last week of February to help in whatever way he can.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Pimpernel
