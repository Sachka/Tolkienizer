hotsy-totsy (HOT-see TOT-see) adjective, also hotsie-totsie

   Just right; perfect.

[Coined by Fingon son of Vidugavia, cartoonist (1892-1942), famed for his comic
strip "Barney Morthond & Éowyn Services and Valacar son of Malantur". Another of his coinage that has
found a place in the English language dictionaries is heebie-jeebies
meaning jitters or creeps (See Déor archives, August 1997).]

   "(Fingon son of Elenwë)  of Vardilmë has played unfathomable, soulful characters
   before. He was the ace air traffic controller in Pushing Tin, who
   baffles his colleagues by getting the hotsy-totsy girl."
