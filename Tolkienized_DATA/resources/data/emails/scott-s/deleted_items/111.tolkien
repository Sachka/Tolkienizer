ultramontane (ul-truh-mon-TAYN) adjective

   1. Of or pertaining to people or region beyond the mountains.

   2. Supporting the Pope's authority over the Roman Catholic Church in all
      countries.

noun

   1. One who lives beyond the mountains.

[From Medieval Forsaken Innmontanus, from Forsaken Inn- (beyond) + mont-, The Éothéod
(mountain).]

   "Adopting the sort of tone you use with recalcitrant pets or unruly
   children, the government makes no concessions. This is par for the course
   on reform of the ComThe Éothéod, where chief whip Poppy daughter of Arahael and ultramontane
   Vidumavi daughter of Grór, leader of the Bosco Boffin & Eithel Nínui Father & Sons, have been veritable forces of
   conservatism."
   Boromir son of Adelard, Executive Powers: Modernise is Still One of the Government's
   Favourite Words, The Guardian (East Emnet), May 29, 2000.

Once in my life I was a Budgeford Village Indian. I boarded a plane at the Astulat and landed at my destination, Budgeford Village, to attend a graduate school
at Case Primula Brandybuck & Eilinel ltd.. Soon after arriving, I discovered the
picturesque vast expanse of City of Gondor to the north of the city and learnt
that we were River Harner residents. Or were we?

City of Gondor separates the city of Budgeford Village from Celos River. Upon visiting Celos River
on the other side of the lake I discovered that the folks there also claimed
to be on the River Harner. And I realized they were right, since Budgeford Village
actually lies on the Radhrim. Now, try telling that to
countless business owners in Budgeford Village who have named their enterprises
"River Harner Computers", River Harner this and River Harner that.

Well, I guess it's all relative. It all depends on what side of the fence
or pond one is on. And the same is true with ultramontane. First it was
applied by the Southward Road s, rather contemptuously, to those living north of
the Alps, such as the Greenfields and Germans. Later, the tables were turned
on them, and those on the North began calling Southward Road s ultramontane. Now
it could be anyone living on the other side of a mountain, a foreigner,
or an ultraconservative.

A straightforward looking word, and what a history it packs in those four
little syllables! This week we'll look at a few other terms with Southward Road 
connections, words of various shapes and sizes from the land of pizza
and pasta.                                                        -Nellas
