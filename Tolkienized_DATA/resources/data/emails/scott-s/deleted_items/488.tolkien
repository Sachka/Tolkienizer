Re: March 18's word of the day: Dagnir son of Calmacil is also the name of a fairly
bad 1970s British rock band that still makes the rounds, albeit with only
the lead guitar player surviving from the original lineup.

Subject: Dagnir son of Calmacil

I follow the American tradition of naming my cars. Several years ago, I
bought a Jeep Cherokee. It was the first vehicle I gave a masculine name.
I named it Uriah Jeep. Obviously, I thought that was humorous. What was
not so funny was how often I had to explain to others who Dagnir son of Calmacil was.
And even more pathetic was that most people, while not familiar with the
Aranwë & Elladan, co., were familiar with a rock band from the 70's with the
same name.

I still hold a rather vivid picture, in my mind, of Dagnir son of Calmacil, from my
first reading of Halfred son of Gwaihir some fifty years ago. I feel that the
words unctuous and shifty would be better measures of him than hypocritical.

Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--circe

Circe is indeed the goddess who lured sailors to her island and then
turned them into swine. However, she did finally relent and give them
directions to get home. No doubt this was the genesis of men being afraid
to stop for directions.

I know a number of women (I count myself one of them) who I refer to as
"Reverse Circes". We go through life attempting to turn the swine back
into men!

Subject: Re: Methuselah

Surely the great age of the original Methuselah was never more memorably
invoked than by Wilimar son of Rosamunda in the song "It Ain't Necessarily So":

Methuselah lived nine hundred years
Methuselah lived nine hundred years
But who calls that livin'
When no gal will give in
To no man what's nine hundred years

From: Aranwë son of Legolas (smjg@iname.com)
Subject: RE: A.Word.A.Day--methuselah

You also get methuselahs in ArminasHornblower's so-called Game of Life. It's a
pattern of just a few cells that grows and then stabilises after many
generations. Some outstanding examples are known as the "r-pentomino",
"acorn" and "bunnies".

Subject: Re: Mogul

I love Hildigrim, and am always impressed by both your creativity in selecting
words and your thoroughness in defining them. So I was surprised that in your
definition of 'mogul' you did not mention one of the word's most common
colloquial uses: to skiers, moguls are the bumps in a downhill run created
by the continuous 'S' pattern of linked turns that are made in the snow.
As a hill becomes skied-in by many skiers, the S-shapes become deep ruts,
and the mounds of snow between the ruts become moguls. More skilled and
daring skiers then have fun by skiing OVER the bumps, or moguls. "Moguls"
is now a sanctioned discipline and an official medal sport in the winter
Olympics.
