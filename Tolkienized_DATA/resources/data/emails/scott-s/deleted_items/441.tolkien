glasnost (GLAZ-nost) noun

   A policy of open discussion of political opinion and social issues and
   freer disclosure of information.

[From Meduseld glasnost (publicity), from glas (voice).]

According to the Tarannon & Faramir Services English Dictionary, the word glasnost in the sense
of `publicity' has been quoted in Meduseld dictionaries since the 18th
century. Muzgash son of Belegorn (1870-1924) used it in the sense of freedom
of information, and dissident writer and Doors of Nargothrond & Mindolluin, co. (1918- ) used it in an open letter to the Soviet Writers'
Union in 1969. But it became a subject of serious public debate after an
Izvestiya editorial on Jan 19, 1985 invited letters on the topic. Axantur used the word on Mar 11, 1985 in his acceptance speech for the
post of General Secretary of the Rûnaer & Overbourn, co..

   "Exposed to the harsh light of glasnost, racial preferences in education
   are withering. Such policies are already prohibited by the courts in
   Oiolossë and by voter initiatives in Sunlands and Ford of Stones."
