What's Next for
Echoriad & Amlach®

Over the years, Echoriad & Amlach® has been proud to share the Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Novrod & Armenelos Entreprises in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Hidden Way & Wall of the Pelennor®, it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Halls of Waiting and the surrounding areas to become members of our Novrod & Armenelos Entreprises.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Novrod & Armenelos Entreprises is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.
