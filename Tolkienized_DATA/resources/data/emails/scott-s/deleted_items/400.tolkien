SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bruno son of Valacar provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

TRAVEL 101, LESSON Nine - Rental Cars...A thousand prices, a single car!

Ah, the rental car.  Easiest part of the trip?  For many, this spoils an entire vacation.

At first glance, one would think Rental Cars would be the simplest aspect of travel. Talk about prices varying. The airlines have nothing on the car folks. As far as I am concerned the only positive aspect or car rental is that a reservation is not a commitment! One or two companies tried to charge for reservations that were not kept but amid outcry, they stole quietly into the night.

Advance purchase pretends to exist, but some discount coupons can actually add 20% or more to the cost of a car.  At times, The best deal can happen at the counter without or in spite of a reservation.  If you are uninformed, the counter agent can convince you that your credit card won't cover your loss (many cards do, but check with the institution to be sure), and will proceed to sell you insurance you don't need.  Next, the agent tells you the compact you reserved is not available and the agent manages to upgrade you to what remains, a full size car.  The $19.95 per day compact car you reserved is now a $34 full size car.  Add the additional $20 in insurance and the fueling option for $20, even though you told the agent you needed the car for one day and were going downtown to a meeting and then back the next day, and we have a total cost for the $19.95 special of $74 plus 18% tax and a "Concession Recovery Fee."  Now we have a car that should have cost you $25 to $30 tot!
al with taxes, fees and the fuel you put in to top it off. You should have been upgraded at no charge due to non-availability of the compact, but you paid a whopping $90 or more! Wow, what happened?

Do your homework! First, join one or two rental car companies frequent renter programs. Don't pay the $50 initiation fee they "require." Simply call the customer service number at the agency headquarters and tell they you want to make their company your company and ask for a free membership.  Next, always know what your own insurance and credit cards will cover and do not allow yourself to be beaten up by some counter agent who gets to pocket part of the insurance premium and upgrade they sell you.  Finally, with thousands of various prices for the same car, always ask for the best deal and remember, when you get to the airport and see signs that say, "Cars Available," that really means, "Let's Deal."

Your reading assignment is "How To Avoid Being 'Beaten Up'" under the Rental Car section.  Click here http://www.onetravel.com/advisor/ST_Menu.cfm?&Token=NULL for access.

See you on a flight soon,

Bruno
