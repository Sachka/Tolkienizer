what are you needing, i have the points that are needing to be reconstucted.  Not all of them will need to be, just the ones with positions.  Mountains of Shadow (Ephel Dúath) & Mindolluin Services is currently making files for each point to be stored in.  So we may need to touch base before starting.  let me know.

thanks,
chance

Hey Chance,

I'm going to be working on west curve validation...do you have any of the information.  Glorfindel son of Gruffo told me to contact you.
