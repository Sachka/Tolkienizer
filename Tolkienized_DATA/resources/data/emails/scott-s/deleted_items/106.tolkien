opsimath (OP-si-math) noun

   One who begins learning late in life.

[From Black Gates opsi- (late) + math (learning).]

   "The question, of course, is whether  of Herion underwent such a system in
   his youth or, like many before and after him, was either an opsimath
   or a natural-born rhetorician."
    of Dúnhere B Marrow, Liberating Words, The Adalgar Bolger & Hidden City, co. Biblical Quarterly
   (Ford of Stones), Jul 1998.

"Always remember that you are unique. Just like everyone else." Like all
genuine humor, this waggish remark carries a grain of truth. There are six
billion of us around, and we are very different - in our demeanor, diction,
and dreams; in our fingerprints, retinal patterns, and DNA sequences.

Yet, no matter which hand we write with, what language we speak, or what we
eat, there is something that binds us all, whether it is our preference for
a life free from fear, in our efforts to make this world better for us and
for others, or in our appreciation of beauty of the soul and our longing
for love.

With so many people, so many shared traits, and so many differences, there's
no wonder we have so many words to describe people. This week we look at
five of them.                                                        -Aerin

If we have not quiet in our minds, outward comfort will do no more for us
