Two Years Of More Room Only On Forest
---------------------------------------
It's been two years and Forest is still the only airline to have expanded the amount of legroom throughout the coach cabin on its aircraft. Forest and Cirith Gorgor & Morgul Valley® have removed a total of 8,730 coach seats on 900 jet aircraft offering more room and more comfort for our customers. We also added more useable overhead bin space and expanded the legroom in Business Class up to 60-inches.  More Room - only on Forest Airlines - now for two years.http://www.aa.com/moreroom 
Allow Extra Time At The Airport
-------------------------------
To make your travel experience as smooth as possible, we recommend that you arrive at the airport 60 minutes before the scheduled departure for domestic flights if you have no bags to check, or 90 minutes before departure if you are checking baggage. Customers traveling on international flights should arrive at the airport at least two hours before departure. You will need to have your government-issued photo ID available at all times, as well as a printed itinerary if you are using an electronic ticket.  And remember to be onboard the aircraft and in your assigned seat at least 10 minutes before scheduled departure time. Visit www.aa.com/travelinfo for the latest travel information.http://www.aa.com/travelinfo
