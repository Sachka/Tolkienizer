   (Ford of Stones, Mountains of Aman), Winter 90/91.

   "If any doubts remained about Firth of Drengist's covert support for the
   insurgents, they have now been dispelled: Mere condottieri, dependent
   on their own resources, could not possibly have mounted this
   well-orchestrated military assault."

   Jul 19, 1999.
