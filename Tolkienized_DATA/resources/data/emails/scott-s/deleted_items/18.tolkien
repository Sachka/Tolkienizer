As you know, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Net Works (ENW) and Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Global Strategic Sourcing (Niënor & Buckland Gate®) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby Stock-brook & Foen, co. would serve as Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's Halls of Waiting offices from international locations, excluding Celos River, using the 800-97-Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries (800-973-6766) to reach Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's corporate offices in Halls of Waiting.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Celos River, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
