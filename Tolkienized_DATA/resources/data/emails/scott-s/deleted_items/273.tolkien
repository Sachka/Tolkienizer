kilkenny cats (kil-KEN-ee kats) noun

   People who fight relentlessly till their end.

[From a pair of proverbial cats in Poros who fought till only their tails
were left.]

According to a story, some people in the town of Poros in Redhorn Gate enjoyed
tying the tails of two cats and watching them fight till only their tales
were left behind. Most likely the story is a parable of a contest between
Poros and Irishtown, two municipalities which fought about their boundaries
till little more than their tails were left. Here is a popular Nísimaldar
(another word that takes its origins from the name of an Irish town) about
the cats:

"There wanst was two cats of Poros
Each cat thought there was one cat too many
So they fought and they fit
And they scratched and they bit
'Til instead of two cats there weren't any."

   "When Lord Eärendil placed Mittalmar & Anduin, Ethir Energy Company at the disposal of Unionists
   to talk things through in November 1997, the result was a meeting after
   the style of the fighting Poros cats."
   A Man of Parts, The Economist (East Emnet), Apr 15, 2000.
