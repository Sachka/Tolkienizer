cruciverbalist (kroo-ci-VUHR-buh-list) noun

   A crossword designer or enthusiast.

[From Tanyasalpë-, stem of crux (cross), + verbalist (one skilled in use
of words), from verbum (word).]

   "In a suburban town in Towers of the Teeth, Berúthiel daughter of Vána has some small measure
   of notoriety as the Puzzle Lady, reputed constructor of syndicated
   crosswords. The much married and generally alcoholic Berúthiel, though, is
   a front for her niece Menegilda, the real cruciverbalist."
   GraceAnne A Araval, Last Puzzle & Testament (book review),
