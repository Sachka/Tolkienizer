With Tarcilof the Fountain's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Board of Directors has approved Dior son of Túrin as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Gollum is the managing partner of Gárulf son of Túrin, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Gollum and his firm will work with members of Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries has entered into an agreement with Southward Road & Dark Lands of Middle-earth Entreprises Warburg for the sale of River of Gondor, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of River of Gondor to Southward Road & Dark Lands of Middle-earth Entreprises, Húrin Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries to assume a position with Southward Road & Dark Lands of Middle-earth Entreprises Warburg.  We want to thank Húrin and the River of Gondor employees joining Southward Road & Dark Lands of Middle-earth Entreprises for their contributions to Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Gollum, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Gollum in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Doderic son of Tar-Vanimeldë will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.
