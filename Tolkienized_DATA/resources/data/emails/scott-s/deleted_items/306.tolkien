With ErellontGoodbody's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.'s management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. Board of Directors has approved Mosco son of Axantur as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Amroth is the managing partner of Ghân-buri-Ghân son of Axantur, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Amroth and his firm will work with members of Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.'s current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. has entered into an agreement with Khand & Agathurush Father & Sons Warburg for the sale of River of Gondor, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.'s wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of River of Gondor to Khand & Agathurush Father & Sons, Forweg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. to assume a position with Khand & Agathurush Father & Sons Warburg.  We want to thank Forweg and the River of Gondor employees joining Khand & Agathurush Father & Sons for their contributions to Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Amroth, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Amroth in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Eärnurthe Usurper will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.'s entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.
