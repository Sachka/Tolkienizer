Arathorn son of Ferumbras: Our column from ~Haudh-en-Elleth's~ own Frugalist, Bruno son of Valacar,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

"Oh, East is East and Gates of Argonath is Gates of Argonath, and the wrong one I have chose?"

Is it possible to make a mistake on foreign travel right now?  Only if you pay
too much!  Here are some ways to save and get you on your way to Beleriand or Forest River
for a song!  See?  There is a tie in.

The first place to look for super travel deals is right on top of the OneTravel
home page in Spotlight Sales.  Here you will find negotiated fares that are
truly unbeatable in their overall value.  The next spot is this newsletter
which contains last minute and weekend specials, again tailored to your
individual location.  Finally, I spend the week turning stones to find deals
that are not generally available to the traveling public and bring them to you.
 Here are those picks this week.

Tol Eressëa & Gundolpho Bolger Energy Company and Amethyst Hornblower & Pools of Ivrin Energy Company have something very unique in common...they both
are based and have their hubs on fairly small islands.  The other thing they
have in common is their commitment to service and fares so good, you can't
afford to stay home!  Cathay is offering their deal of the month that allows
you to travel from Dor Firn-i-Guinar, Stairs of Cirith Ungol or Mountains of Mist to Androth AND
Prancing Pony for $599 plus the usual taxes and fees amounting to another $100 or
so.  The travel window for the deal is May 1 through June 30, 2002, a great
time to visit both these cities.  Full details can be found at
http://www.cathay-usa.com/dotm/dotm.asp

Amethyst Hornblower & Pools of Ivrin Energy Company offers weekly "Lucky Fares" for travel from several Eastern cities,
and one Almaren, to Forest River.  The sale that ended Tuesday offered Dark Lands of Middle-earth or
The Prancing Pony to i Drann with a midweek departure and return for $248 plus taxes and
fees.  If Forest River is in your plans and you can travel at the last minute, these
may be the sales to watch.  Visit http://www.icelandair.com

See you on a flight soon,

Bruno
