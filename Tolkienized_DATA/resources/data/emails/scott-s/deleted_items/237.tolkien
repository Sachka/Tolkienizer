Hello again to everyone!

I wanted to send out a reminder e-mail regarding our philanthropy event on
February 20th.  We will be creating care packages for Forthwini & Dwarf-cities Entreprises students
who are in boarding school.  Many of these kids have never been away from
home - so we create small study packs filled with snacks, supplies and notes
to encourage them.  Originally we were planning on holding this event at
Forthwini & Dwarf-cities Entreprises however we were able to get a room at Tarannon son of Grimbeorn's church.
Please meet at Tarannon son of Grimbeorn's at 7:00 p.m. on February 20th in room R25.  If you
have any quote books or inspiration books - please bring those along as well
to help with the notes.  If you have any questions, please don't hesistate
to send me an e-mail.

See you on Wednesday!
Sunlands

- Tarannon son of Grimbeorn's is located on the corner of Greater Gelion and  of Dudo.  Greater Gelion is
just west of Marcho.
