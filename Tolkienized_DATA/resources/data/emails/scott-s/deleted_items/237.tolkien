Hello again to everyone!

I wanted to send out a reminder e-mail regarding our philanthropy event on
February 20th.  We will be creating care packages for Iron Hills & Uglúk Services students
who are in boarding school.  Many of these kids have never been away from
home - so we create small study packs filled with snacks, supplies and notes
to encourage them.  Originally we were planning on holding this event at
Iron Hills & Uglúk Services however we were able to get a room at Boron son of Rufus's church.
Please meet at Boron son of Rufus's at 7:00 p.m. on February 20th in room R25.  If you
have any quote books or inspiration books - please bring those along as well
to help with the notes.  If you have any questions, please don't hesistate
to send me an e-mail.

See you on Wednesday!
Sunlands

- Boron son of Rufus's is located on the corner of Greater Gelion and  of Falco.  Greater Gelion is
just west of Bombur.
- For more info on Hollowbold & The Éothéod Energy Company - please see www.kipp.org
