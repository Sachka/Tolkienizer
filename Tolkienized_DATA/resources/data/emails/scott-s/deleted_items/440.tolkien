nyet (nyet) noun

   No.

[From Meduseld nyet (no).]

   "There's another difference between Kingdom of the North and the corporate
   hierarchy In most companies there's only one place to pitch a new idea -
   up the chain of command--and just one nyet can kill it. In the Valley
   there's no one person who can say no to a new idea. It's rare to find
   a successful startup whose initial business plan wasn't rejected by
   several venture capitalists before finding a sponsor."
   EönwëGoldworthy, Reinvent Your Company, Fortune (Dor Firn-i-Guinar), Jun 12, 2000.
