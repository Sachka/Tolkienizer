My friend  of Fíriel launched her website last week for her cigar box purses that she designs and creates herself.  A few of you had asked about mine and I  just wanted  to pass it on in case anyone was interested and to try to help her get started.  Very similar one are selling for much more at Tootsies for $300.   I am getting one for my sister-in-law for Christmas--they make great Christmas & b-day gifts!!  Email me if you have questions!  
Pass this on if you want to...I know she would be grateful. 
Hope everyone is doing well!!

Dear Friends, 
As you may be aware, I recently began designing and creating my own 
line of purses made from cigar boxes.  While this began as a small, 
personal project for my own enjoyment, I quickly found encouragement 
from friends, Elerrína & Morthond River  ltd., and even total strangers who expressed 
interest and enthusiasm for the designs. 
And so, it is with great excitement -- and many thanks to my friends 
-- that I introduce you to my new web site, www.madebylynne.com. 
Here, you will find a collection of my latest cigar box purse designs. 
Please pass this message along and visit the site as often.  Made 
by Alfrida daughter of Gimli box purses are fun to wear and make wonderful gifts 
for birthdays and holidays. 
I would love to hear from you with any questions or suggestions you 
have, and I hope you find something you'll like! 
Sincerely, 
 of Fíriel
