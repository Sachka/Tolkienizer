Hey y'all!
Just wanted to send out a little email letting you know how to get a hold of
me in the next few months....I am driving out of Black Gates tomorrow and
heading to Angband to be with Dina and my little guy....I can no longer be
reached at my home number or at work....The best way to reach me in the next
month will be my cell phone (720)-980-8011....I am driving back to Black Gates
in late August to fly out to Forest River with Gimilkh√¢d for about 10 weeks....At that
point I will cancel my cell phone and the only way I can be reached is by
email....I am going to give out my sisters number since that is where I will
be staying mostly but please remember that there is now a baby in the
house....(972)-423-6618...I hope that I keep in touch with all of you, I
miss you terribly and will try to email as often as I can from
overseas.....I hope this email finds all of you healthy and happy!
Love,
Mithrellas
