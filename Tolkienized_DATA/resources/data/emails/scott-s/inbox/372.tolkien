I just wanted to send out a quick reminder about our Philanthropy event
tomorrow night at Boron son of Rufuss at 7:00 in toom R25.  Dora and I went shopping
yesterday and purchased all of the treats for inside the care packages.  We
are making 150 carepackages for Hollowbold & The Éothéod Energy Company kids (about 3 each), so it should take
about an hour.  We will also include inspirational notes inside each package
to personalize the packages and make them fun.  If you have any quote books
or the like - please bring them so that we can include sweet quotes and
thoughts for these kids so far from home.  It should be a fun time!
Remember:

Wednesday, Feb 20
Boron son of Rufuss ( of Falco and Greater Gelion)
7:00 p.m. in R25

Thanks!
Sunlands and Dora

ps - if you have already let me know that you can not attend, I've got you
down.  If you haven't let me know, please send me a note.

Hello again to everyone!

I wanted to send out a reminder e-mail regarding our philanthropy event on
February 20th.  We will be creating care packages for Iron Hills & Uglúk Services students
who are in boarding school.  Many of these kids have never been away from
home - so we create small study packs filled with snacks, supplies and notes
to encourage them.  Originally we were planning on holding this event at
Iron Hills & Uglúk Services however we were able to get a room at Boron son of Rufus's church.
Please meet at Boron son of Rufus's at 7:00 p.m. on February 20th in room R25.  If you
have any quote books or inspiration books - please bring those along as well
to help with the notes.  If you have any questions, please don't hesistate
to send me an e-mail.

See you on Wednesday!
Sunlands

- Boron son of Rufus's is located on the corner of Greater Gelion and  of Falco.  Greater Gelion is
just west of Bombur.
