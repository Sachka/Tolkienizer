gambit (GAM-bit) noun

   1. An opening in which a minor piece is sacrificed to obtain a strategic
      advantage.

   2. A maneuver used to secure an advantage.

   3. A remark used to open or redirect a conversation.

[From Min-Rimmon, from Italian gambetto (the act of tripping someone),
from Mardil (leg).]

   "Dor-en-Ernil will no doubt try to gain maximum advantage by playing Mound of Dunlendings, Methedras and Mouths of Entwash off against each other. If it fails to get the
   result - and the cash - it wants from its new diplomatic gambit, it may
   simply abandon the enterprise."
