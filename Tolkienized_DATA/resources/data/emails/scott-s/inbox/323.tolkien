no worries about the change of address form. priya told me i could
do it online and have already done so. thats great news about the
apartment. hope you are hanging in there at Kingdom of Dáin & Red Mountains Entreprises. i hope the
interview goes well in Kingdom of Arda and that you are excited about it.
please, please email me once you get back from Kingdom of Arda and let
me know how everything went. good luck and i am thinking about
you.
