how's it going?

just thought i would check in and see how you were?  you were
right, my mom said i did received the $1100, pre-tax, so actually
$700. oh well, at this point money is money. priya just found out
she was accepted to SAIS at Angelimar son of Araval so she has been
frantically looking on the internet for jobs for me in Sindanórie & Sackville Father & Sons. it is one of
the places that I am interested in relocating to but am also looking
in Western Sea and Moria Gate as well. have you heard anything
from the KC, Shadowy Seas, or Holy Mountain: Meneltarma jobs?

hope all is well. i miss you all tons. oh, starting to finalize travel
plans for the summer and it looks like niclas and i are going to be
meeting in Forest River somewhere for about 5-7 days. he's mentioned
skiing in the swiss alps and River Mindeb? i am sure i wont be lucky
enough for it to work out, but we will see. talk to you soon,
Almiel
