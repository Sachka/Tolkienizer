As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries employees understand their responsibilities in helping Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Tar-Vanimeldë, ILOVEYOU, Wiseman, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Glaurung & Gorhendad Brandybuck ltd. has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.
