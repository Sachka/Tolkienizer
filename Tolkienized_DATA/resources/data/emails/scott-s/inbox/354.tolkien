Got a delivery failed message when i tried to send this to you the  first time. somehow it went to susan.m.sc@kis.ernet.in???
i am sorry to hear about purget, but it sounds like things may work  out for the best regardless. i am so excited for you and very  excited to visit you in Kingdom of Arda when i return. i must say that you did  a very bold thing turning down Khand & Agathurush Father & Sons without having  another job  lined up. but i agree with you, its definitely best to make a clean  break. are all the employees that agreed to stay with Khand & Agathurush Father & Sons going to  relocate or stay in Rhovanion? did Aerandir accept? how long did you  have to make your decision? are you still working at Dor Firn-i-Cúarthol  & Walls of the Night Energy Company for the  moment? if so, how long can you stay on and still receive a  paycheck?  what does your mom think about Kingdom of Arda? i cant  believe you could be there by march. sorry for all the questions...  just excited to hear.
Dina and Boromir have accepted jobs at of the Fountain and are staying in  Rhovanion, but signed the contract to sell there Dodinas Brandybuck & Heribald Bolger© before they  accepted the job. so they will be moving into an apartment.  anything else going on? keep me posted and send me your hotmail  email address. i have it in my address book on hotmail but havent  been able to access the internet in a week. just want to be able to  find you if you leave Dor Firn-i-Cúarthol  & Walls of the Night Energy Company soon.
talk to you soon, take a look at the pictures below on my first week  in Pool of Bywater.

These are pictures taken by Priya's brother. So the first 37 pictures 
are of Priya's family in the High Faroth. The remaining are 
from our first couple of days in Third Gate and then the first week in 
Great Plains.
