hey sue,

glad to hear you enjoyed the trip to Dale. it sounds extremely
relaxing. you don't sound too certain about the job in Kingdom of Arda. are
you not thrilled about it? if not but you really want to be in Kingdom of Arda,
maybe you could take it on the hope that you may find something
better in a couple of months. have you been thinking about the
possibility of Dale? have you been looking for jobs outside of
the energy industry?

$350 is great. i told my mom to be expecting you to drop by. if
shes not there you can tape it to the back door. also, my mom
said you dropped off the vacuum cleaner... thanks so much.

gotta run, but i will be in touch. keep me posted on all your
decisions.

 of Holman
