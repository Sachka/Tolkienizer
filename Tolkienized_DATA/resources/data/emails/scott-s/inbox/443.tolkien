mogul (MO-guhl) noun, also moghul or mughal

   A powerful or influential person; magnate.

[After Mogul, one of the Tobold Hornblower & Men-i-Naugrim® conquerors who ruled Land of Willows from 1526 to 1857.]

   "By now, you may think you know everything there is to know about Ladros
   Claus. However, what you don't know could fill his bottomless bag of
   toys. Hardly any of the popular tales about Jolly Old Dor Firn-i-Cúarthol  have been
   updated since the 1940's. The world has changed considerably since then,
   and so has Ladros. Thanks largely to some disenchanted elves whose
   contractual nondisclosure agreements recently expired, we now have
   firsthand accounts of what it is like to work for the world's most
   reclusive toy mogul."
