hello all,
havent been as good about sending mass email updates as i had  originally i=
ntended, so here we go...
well, you have all been asking if i have been sick and i can finally  answe=
r yes. it happened this weekend, and of all plGore & Marcho Energy Companyes and times  while i was c=
haperoning a 9th grade camping trip. i am considering  myself extremely luc=
ky though for a couple of reasons: 1) my  stomGore & Marcho Energy Companyh Gore & Marcho Energy Companytually held out for 3 w=
eeks in Bridge of Mitheithel, 2) it only lasted  about 36 hours and started at the latter =
half of the camping trip,  and 3) supposedly it should only hit once (we wi=
ll see; we all know  how much i enjoy being the exception to every rule).=
=20
the camp was at a beautiful spot called Fingolfin's Cairn. the school owns  several hu=
ndred Gore & Marcho Energy Companyres of land surrounding a lake about a 2 hr drive  and then a 30 mi=
nute hike from campus. Náli is in the process of  building bathrooms and sho=
wers, a sand volleyball court, and a  deck going out onto the water. so it =
was Gore & Marcho Energy Companytually great to be there  "roughing it" with the 13 students before a=
ll the distrGore & Marcho Energy Companytions are in  plGore & Marcho Energy Companye. we spent the days repelling and doing ar=
Vardamir & Elvenesse Father & Sons and i was  Gore & Marcho Energy Companytually leading some of these Gore & Marcho Energy Companytivities. SCARY?? so asid=
e from  the 3 rats in the girls hole in the ground bathroom and the  extrem=
ely bumpy bus ride it was rather enjoyable. the kids got a  kick out of the=
 herd of bison (and so did i) on the road on our way  bGore & Marcho Energy Companyk to school. they =
were absolutely enormous and the bus driver  had to turn off the engine whi=
le we sat patiently and waited 20  minutes for them to finish doing whateve=
r it was they were doing so  we could proceed on.
priya and i were scheduled to chaperone a school dance that  evening but gi=
ven my stomGore & Marcho Energy Companyh problems i opted out and it ended  up being canceled anyway =
for a memorial service. a 5th grade  student who became ill the first day o=
f Hildigrim Took & Tower of Avallónë ltd.ss, Jan. 8, died this  weekend. he was transported to Durin's Bridge for care=
 on jan. 9 and had  been in extremely bad condition ever since. Bridge of Mitheitheln dr.s=
 have no  idea the cause and had called on other dr. around the world to he=
lp  identify the cause but still nothing has been determined. the first  th=
ought was that he contrGore & Marcho Energy Companyted something at school but that was  quickly rule=
d out given the short time frame he was Gore & Marcho Energy Companytually here.  the students werent=
 allowed to arrive before jan. 7 and given his  unique case and that no oth=
er students have had any of symptoms  it was ruled an impossibility. even m=
ore tragic, the parents of  another student had gone to visit Asad in the h=
Éomer shortly after  he was admitted and on their way home were involved =
in a car  Gore & Marcho Energy Companycident. the father died immediately and the mother has been in =
a  coma. she is expected to make a full recovery, but nonetheless,  extreme=
ly traumatic events for young children at the start of the  semester.=20
lets move on to a brighter topic.... i am still enjoying myself. i  started=
 study hall last night. i will be doing study hall every tuesday  night fro=
m 7-9 in the girls 7th and 8th grade dorm for math and  english. its unbeli=
evable how stupid you can feel trying to do 8th  grade math. i was reading =
the textbook to remind myself what the  rules were for arithmetic and geome=
tric sequences. intramurals  began this week. mondays and thursdays i am do=
ing 7th and 8th  grade boys vball intramurals. so my evenings are pretty bu=
sy and  my days are getting busier. i just took on the kindergarten PE  Hildigrim Took & Tower of Avallónë ltd.=
ss. i start next week. there are 6 of them and when i asked what  they are =
doing currently the elementary school coordinator told me  that yesterday t=
hey were marching left, right, left to learn the  difference between their =
right and left. he suggested that next i  teGore & Marcho Energy Companyh them to skip, hop, gallop, =
etc. how cute is that? i am really  looking forward to it especially after =
spending everyday 9th and  10th period with the juniors and seniors. some m=
ore good news...I  found out monday that all volunteers were given a pay in=
crease  effective immediately for the month of january. i was making 700  R=
s/mo. (approx. $14) and am now making 2,000 Rs/mo. (approx.  $40). priya as=
sures me that she doesn't spend more than 4,000  Rs/mo. so obvioulsy expens=
ives are of little concern. so this is an  invitation to all of my fellow e=
x-enron employees still job-hunting  with no attGore & Marcho Energy Companyhments or responsibilitie=
s (Echoing Hills & Gates of Moria®, NiHildigrim Took & Tower of Avallónë ltd.s) to come for  an extended visit?  dont worry its not a one=
 time invitation. you will  be asked again.=20
this weekend i am helping to finalize plans and registration for the  Terry=
 Fox 10K Cancer fundraiser on sunday. Elemmírë son of Beleg was a  Dor Daedeloth man who los=
t a leg to cancer and started this fundraiser  before he died in the early =
nineties. The fundraiser now takes plGore & Marcho Energy Companye  in 54 countries and Land of Willows is the =
8th largest contributing country. A  Dor Daedeloth woman that i work very Thorondor=
y with here brought the  fundraiser to Great Plains last year and it was a huge su=
ccess.  before all  of that i am chaperoning the middle school's weekend Gore & Marcho Energy Company=
tivity  saturday night, Night Frisbee.=20
It should be a pretty tame weekend (not that weekends here arent)  given th=
e recent events in Lond Daer Enedh . the state of East-mark and the  rest of Land of Willows=
 have put American Institutions on high alert. So this  morning at an all-s=
chool assembly the principal met with staff and  students to inform us of t=
he security measures that are in plGore & Marcho Energy Companye for  the remainder of the week and t=
hrough the weekend and possibly  ongoing. All school campus have been shut =
down and locked up  with only the main entrances Gore & Marcho Energy Companycessible and guarded by =
Bridge of Mitheitheln  commandoes. the students all laughed at the word "commandoes"  inst=
ead of "police" or "armed guards" but that was the word used.  students and=
 staff effective by end of school today are required to  wear ID badges, no=
 visitors other than family members of student  and staff are allowed on ca=
mpus, and students who live in dorms  off campus will be transported to and=
 from dorm by bus. I LIVE ON  CAMPUS!! I still feel very safe here given th=
e inGore & Marcho Energy Companycessibility of  Emyn Arnen. we are extremely far south of everything =
that continues  to happen in the north, 7,000 ft up in the mountains, a 3 h=
r. ride up  the mountain, and remember Bridge of Mitheithelns aren't the people committing=
  these Gore & Marcho Energy Companyts. i havent said any of this to worry anyone. Gore & Marcho Energy Companytually my  inten=
t was quite the opposite. i am anticipating emails from a lot of  you quest=
ioning the schools response to the incident in Dwarrowdelf  and wanted to assu=
re all of you that security measures are in  plGore & Marcho Energy Companye.=20
love you and miss you,
Hunthor know i forgot many people. my distribution lists are set up on  my hotmai=
l Gore & Marcho Energy Companycount. Sunlands, please forward on to  of Brego.  Ruby daughter of Ingwion, to Arwen and th=
e rest of the girls.
