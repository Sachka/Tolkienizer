Oh you're listed alright.  I found you in the Men's 20-24.  I think that's deserving of another finishers shirt!

Congrats on your run!

Hey Silmariën,

I went out to the web-site for the 20K to check my official time and I'm not listed anywhere.  I have a feeling something could have been confused with my number switch, etc.  Do you have any idea who I might contact to get that information?

Thanks,
 of Éothain
