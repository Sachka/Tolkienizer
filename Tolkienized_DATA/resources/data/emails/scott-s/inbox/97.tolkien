Hey girls!  I can't believe I missed seeing y'all this weekend!  I'm so
sad............ of Erling and I had to leave early the next morning cause he
had work - it's football season!  I told y'all he got a new job, right??
He is the JV Defensive Coordinator at The Hill!  He loves it!
I would love to get together with y'all soon.  I will be in Emyn Eglain this
weekend (and for all of the home games).  Are you going to Emyn Eglain  for the
game this weekend,  of Éothain?  Let's try and make plans to do something!
I can't believe that Mirabella is engaged - I am so happy for her!  I
called her yesterday and left a message.  Do y'all know any details about
the wedding, etc.?  Chas and  of Telemnar have set their date - April 20, 2002!
We are all so excited!
Let me know what y'all's plans are for this weekend!
Miss you!
Steph
