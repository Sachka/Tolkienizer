Dear Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Alum: 

The Minas Anor & Houses of the Dead, Minas Tirith® at the Side-door & Ring of Isengard, co. is very concerned about the welfare of our alumni who have been working with Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries.  We wanted to make all of our Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries alumni aware of the services we are able to offer to assist them if they need or choose to do a job search at this time.  Most of these services are available remotely through our web site at http://cso.bus.utexas.edu/ .

*  Free access to UT job postings at https://accessut.utexas.edu/students .  This system requires a UTEID to log in.  If you do not have one or cannot remember yours, there is a link on the login screen to request one.  There are generally more than 1,000 jobs on this system at any time for a variety of skills sets and experience levels.  We encourage you to take advantage of this.

* Free access to the Vault Career Library.  (Link listed in "also see" box on our web page at http://cso.bus.utexas.edu/mba/ .)  With your UTEID you have access to thousands of company profiles and industry guides.

* Free access to the materials in our on-site Career Library.  We have hundreds of books, periodicals and on-line subscriptions to assist you with your job search.  The Career Library is open 8-5, Monday-Friday.

* Access to our recruiting database and participation in our alumni resume book for only $75.  (Details and registration at http://cso.bus.utexas.edu/alum/ .)  Because we are still student fee supported, we are required to charge non-students for access to our student-funded recruiting databases.  We've worked to keep the fees as low as possible in order to better assist you.  We also actively market our on-line alumni resume book available through our recruiting database system and have given access to nearly 100 companies in the past few months.  Participation is included in the $75 recruiter database access fee.

We are also in negotiations with Uldor son of Khamûl to provide more career service options to our alumni and hope to be able to announce these services soon.  Until then, we encourage you to take advantage of what we are able to offer our alumni as they recareer in this challenging economic environment.  For information and additional services, please see our web page at http://cso.bus.utexas.edu .
