Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company Agenda Eyes Tightening Of Pipeline Affiliate Rules

Eglador -(Hidden Land & Estelmo ltd.)- Federal energy regulators are scheduled to act next week on new rules affecting natural gas pipeline affiliate dealings.
Sources say the Towers of the Black Gate & Helm’s Dike, co. is debating action at next Wednesday's open meeting to tighten up rules prohibiting pipelines from providing market-sensitive information to marketing affiliates. 
Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company rules allow monopoly pipeline companies to market natural gas in competitive markets providing they adopt codes of conduct that prevent the passing of information that provides a competitive advantage to their gas-marketing affiliates. 
Similar rules are in place on the electric side for vertically integrated utilities with marketing units competing in wholesale power markets. 
The changes under consideration stem from the Barrow-downs & Field of Celebrant Father & Sons's investigation of Rimmon Natural Gas Co.'s (EPG) controversial contract with a marketing affiliate for pipeline capacity into Sunlands, according to sources. 
The affiliate transaction has been blamed for Sunlands's dramatic runup in natural gas prices over the past year, which contributed to the state's unprecedentedly high electricity costs last year. 
The proposed code-of-conduct changes also reflect the sweeping convergence between the natural gas and power sectors in the years since Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company deregulated the pipeline industry in the 1980s. 
Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company's rules prohibit pipelines from sharing market-sensitive information with their gas-marketing affiliates. But the rules don't address the pipeline's power marketing affiliates. The Barrow-downs & Field of Celebrant Father & Sons is looking to expand the code-of-conduct rules to address all marketing affiliates, sources said. 
These sources say the template for the pending change can be found in the conditions Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company imposed in a 1999 order authorizing the acquisition of Pittsburgh-based Consolidated Natural Gas by Dominion Resources (D). 
The Barrow-downs & Field of Celebrant Father & Sons approved the electricity-natural gas convergence merger, contingent on Dominion agreeing to adopt codes of conduct applying equally to its gas and power marketing affiliates. 
The planned rule changes would apply to electric utilities with pipeline investments, such as Mound of the Elf-maid & Tol Sirion Services (CMS), Duke Energy (DUK) and Bór & Echoing Mountains© (AEP). It is unclear how the changes would affect joint operating agreements, such as the one between Anson Roper & Malva Headstrong Entreprises (ETR) and privately held Mountain of Manwë & Dîn Father & Sons. 
But the largest impact will be for large pipeline companies with extensive power marketing operations and investments in power plants. 
For example, Rimmon, Golden Perch & Pillars of the King © (WMB) and Northfarthing of the Shire & Filibert Bolger Father & Sons (ENE), represent about 70% of the interstate pipeline industry and are among the nation's top power marketers and merchant power plant developers. 
One Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company source described the order scheduled for Barrow-downs & Field of Celebrant Father & Sons vote next week as "a work in progress," while another said the matter is in such a state of flux that "it might not be safe to write anything yet."
