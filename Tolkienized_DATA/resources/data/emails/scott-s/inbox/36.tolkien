Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises Agenda Eyes Tightening Of Pipeline Affiliate Rules

Eglador -(Mound of Avarice  & Firth of Rómenna ltd.)- Federal energy regulators are scheduled to act next week on new rules affecting natural gas pipeline affiliate dealings.
Sources say the Porto Baggins & Hollin Gate ltd. is debating action at next Wednesday's open meeting to tighten up rules prohibiting pipelines from providing market-sensitive information to marketing affiliates. 
Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises rules allow monopoly pipeline companies to market natural gas in competitive markets providing they adopt codes of conduct that prevent the passing of information that provides a competitive advantage to their gas-marketing affiliates. 
Similar rules are in place on the electric side for vertically integrated utilities with marketing units competing in wholesale power markets. 
The changes under consideration stem from the Iron Mountains & Withered Wold, co.'s investigation of Rimmon Natural Gas Co.'s (EPG) controversial contract with a marketing affiliate for pipeline capacity into Sunlands, according to sources. 
The affiliate transaction has been blamed for Sunlands's dramatic runup in natural gas prices over the past year, which contributed to the state's unprecedentedly high electricity costs last year. 
The proposed code-of-conduct changes also reflect the sweeping convergence between the natural gas and power sectors in the years since Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises deregulated the pipeline industry in the 1980s. 
Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises's rules prohibit pipelines from sharing market-sensitive information with their gas-marketing affiliates. But the rules don't address the pipeline's power marketing affiliates. The Iron Mountains & Withered Wold, co. is looking to expand the code-of-conduct rules to address all marketing affiliates, sources said. 
These sources say the template for the pending change can be found in the conditions Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises imposed in a 1999 order authorizing the acquisition of Pittsburgh-based Consolidated Natural Gas by Dominion Resources (D). 
The Iron Mountains & Withered Wold, co. approved the electricity-natural gas convergence merger, contingent on Dominion agreeing to adopt codes of conduct applying equally to its gas and power marketing affiliates. 
The planned rule changes would apply to electric utilities with pipeline investments, such as Far Harad & Pervinca Took Services (CMS), Duke Energy (DUK) and Walda & Elenna, co. (AEP). It is unclear how the changes would affect joint operating agreements, such as the one between Nunduinë & Birchwoods of Nimbrethil ltd. (ETR) and privately held Anfauglith & Horse-country Father & Sons. 
But the largest impact will be for large pipeline companies with extensive power marketing operations and investments in power plants. 
For example, Rimmon, Fingolfin & Hamfast Gamgee Entreprises (WMB) and Mountains of Mirkwood & Eithil Ivrin© (ENE), represent about 70% of the interstate pipeline industry and are among the nation's top power marketers and merchant power plant developers. 
One Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises source described the order scheduled for Iron Mountains & Withered Wold, co. vote next week as "a work in progress," while another said the matter is in such a state of flux that "it might not be safe to write anything yet."
