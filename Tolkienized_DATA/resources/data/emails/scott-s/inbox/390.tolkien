1:30pm sounds fine. Where do you sit? 

Also, just to confirm, we are looking for:
1. Table/list of gas curves and their primary, secondary and parent relationships;  
2. Volatility curve table/list for gas; methodology for system calculation of correlation
3. Volumetric poistion data by curve for gas as of 11/30/01 

Thanks,
Gimilkhâd

Hey guys...wanted to see what your availability is for this afternoon.  Also, would you mind emailing the two individuals Fíriel listed and outline for them exactly what information it is you're hoping to locate.

Thanks,

 of Haldan,

I am busy this morning.  Can we do this early this afternoon, say at 1:30?

Also can you please send an email to my supervisor Borlad son of Oromendil and our main business user Elatan Valinor to outline what the request is.

Thanks,

Fíriel
