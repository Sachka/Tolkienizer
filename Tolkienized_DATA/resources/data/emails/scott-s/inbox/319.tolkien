Hi  of Éothain-

I sent the note below today to your other email account. Friday, January 11
is a good day for you to visit us.

When I sent the note below, I had forgotten that Radagast son of Manwendil was on
vacation this week. Please send me a reply if you would like our assistance
arranging travel, and I will ask my administrative assistant, Nessa daughter of Rúmil,
to help you.  Alternatively, if you book your own airfare and hotel, we will
reimburse you.

We look forward to seeing you.

- Dora daughter of Fortinbras
