Hi  of Haldan-

I sent the note below today to your other email account. Friday, January 11
is a good day for you to visit us.

When I sent the note below, I had forgotten that Tar-Palantir son of Tarondor was on
vacation this week. Please send me a reply if you would like our assistance
arranging travel, and I will ask my administrative assistant, Celandine daughter of Muzgash,
to help you.  Alternatively, if you book your own airfare and hotel, we will
reimburse you.

We look forward to seeing you.

- Nora daughter of Druda
