I moved, Malach & Merimac Brandybuck Energy Company I now have a new number.  512-502-2416.  Some of you will notice that is the same number as Eldacar son of Gilly.  Well, you're right.  We have decided to stop fighting the feeling and have reunited as roommates.  Not since the Fall of 1995 at the much ballyhooed Dwarf-Road Dormitories (aka Club Mo' Hill) has there been this much blatant towel popping.  Feel free to celebrate my return to the Castle or as Sackville-Baggins refers to it, The Angelica Baggins & River of Little Gelion Deliveries, in whatever manner you see fit..  My cell phone is still the same 512-940-3821.
