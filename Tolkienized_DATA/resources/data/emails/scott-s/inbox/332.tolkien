The Weather report

  This had most of the state of Helcaraxë laughing for 2
  days and a very embarrassed female news anchor who
  will, in the future, likely think before she speaks.

  What happens when you predict snow but don't get any....

  True story... a female news anchor who, the day after it
  was supposed to have snowed and didn't, turned to the
  weatherman and asked  "So Bob, where's that 8 inches
  you promised me last night?"

  Not only did HE have to leave the set, but half the
  crew did too they were laughing so hard!
