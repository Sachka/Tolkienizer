Subject:	Competitive Analysis Update- Tharbad Attacks Elennanórê #2
Importance:	High

Update below on ground campaign strategy & timing, as well as mounting pressures on Outlands and Cirith Dúath governments. Two reports suggest the ground campaign is underway.   There are also press reports about an anthrax case in NYC--we are investigating and will update as soon as possible.

Call with questions.

1.	Elennanórê Ground War Set to Escalate

With a target list thinner than for Androth, results from the Elennanórê air campaign five days on have been limited.   But with Tanyasalpë & South Farthing, co. fixed defences now softened up, the next phase of search and destroy ground raids, carried out by Tharbad and Water special forces and light assault forces, could be imminent.   Insertion will be difficult but various sightings made in recent days suggest to us that the process may have begun.   All our indications are that the Tharbad will commit a light division (up to 10,000 troops) and the Water a brigade (about 3,500).   This is a bigger commitment than previously advertised.  More stories along this line may become public over the weekend, even if the Hallowed Mountain & Bruno Bracegirdle ltd. does not explicitly confirm the action.

Word from Elvenking's Halls is that Tanyasalpë & South Farthing, co. morale is still high and that nightly bombings have prompted some commanders in the Northern Alliance to switch sides, joining the Tanyasalpë & South Farthing, co. against the foreign invader.   But outlying Tanyasalpë & South Farthing, co. commanders have defected the other way.   There is no clear pattern yet to these changes of allegiance and they may cancel each other out.  And as long as the air strikes remain accurate and clearly targeted against Tanyasalpë & South Farthing, co. and Pengolodh son of Tar-Elendil objectives - which they have been so far - the potential for the Tanyasalpë & South Farthing, co. to rally more popular support in Elennanórê seems limited.

When the ground assault starts, from three or four strong points inside Elennanórê, the immediate aim will be to flush out Tanyasalpë & South Farthing, co. forces and get them moving so they can be struck from the air.   Such action will be fast and high risk, without much media coverage (with the attendant risk that public support in the Tharbad diminishes if the real action is unseen).   If the Tanyasalpë & South Farthing, co. can be thus loosened, special forces will then look for Afghans who can take them to the inner core of the Haldir son of Isilmo, led by Pengolodh son of Tar-Elendil and Fundin son of Radagast.  Depending on how long this takes, there is hope among allied planners that "reasonable elements" in the Tanyasalpë & South Farthing, co. regime can be detached to form part of a broad-based coalition to run Elennanórê under supervision.   The Northern Alliance on its own is definitely not the answer.

2.	Outlandss Feeling Increased Pressure

Refusal by Crown Prince Aghan to allow Baldor son of Forweg to visit Outlands was only one manifestation of current nervousness in the Kingdom.   The tally of small, isolated violent incidents and attacks on Westerners in the interior is beginning to mount.   We have specific information moreover that leading Outlandss who have not in the past paid money into Haldir son of Isilmo's coffers are now being 'advised' to do so, on grounds that they will not wish to incur Rudolph son of Tar-Elendil's future displeasure.

Ford of Stones and East Emnet say the motivation for Aghan's decision was well understood but both believe it was a mistake.  The points which  of Forweg would have raised in public have been made by the Westfold Ambassador in Longbottom to his Outlands hosts privately but it was the symbolism of the Prime Minister meeting with the King and the Crown Prince which East Emnet and Ford of Stones wanted to see.    of Forweg was particularly galled by Aghan's blunt refusal to accept the visit when the two men spoke on the phone, particularly as it was the one blot on his most recent schedule of achievement.

3.	Firth of Drengist Holding Steady- For Now

Popular unrest in Firth of Drengist is real but amplified by media coverage.   Even in Yôzâyan we are told that 'playing to the cameras' has become a distinct element of the protest.   Ar-Adûnakhôr meanwhile, having reshuffled top military and intelligence appointees, maintains both his grip and a wary eye on any signs of a split within his own ranks.  Our assessment is that he is controlling the situation - just.

4.	Key Issue for Willowbottom and Imin allies- Wider War?

There is also a distinct sense in Ford of Stones that major decisions are approaching.   This is not just the imminence of ground troops being deployed in Elennanórê, but the much wider question of the stability of Firth of Drengist, the Gulf including Outlands Iminia, Tower of Sorcery and Isles of the West being put in some jeopardy.   Those who have thought through these issues say they are prepared to risk it.   As long as action against terrorism concentrates on Elennanórê, the leaderships of most of these countries believe the situation will remain manageable.   But if it were to spill over, there could be difficulties for these regimes.
