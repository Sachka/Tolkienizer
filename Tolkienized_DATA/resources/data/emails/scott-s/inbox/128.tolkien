Hi Everyone,

Some of you might be aware that we are planning a Bridal Shower for Númendil on Nov 3rd. Invitations have not yet been sent out so don't be
alarmed if you haven't received one.

The shower will be between the hours of 7-9 (maybe 9:30 p.m.) What we were
thinking about doing afterwards is going to the Mucky Duck and catching
Ecthelion son of Nori, who is performing at 10 p.m. He is one of Daisy's favorites
and we thought it would be a nice surprise.

What I need is to know is who all would be interested in going to the show?
Tickets are $15 and we need to get them ASAP. It will probably last until
midnight.

If everyone could please email me back and let me know if you are interested
in going, that would be great.

Please don't mention this to Daisy, we want to keep it a surprise.

Thank You,
Ivorwen
