As you know, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. Net Works (ENW) and Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. Global Strategic Sourcing (Ulbar & The Long Wall Deliveries) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby Far Downs & Harad Road Energy Company would serve as Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.'s primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.'s Halls of Waiting offices from international locations, excluding Celos River, using the 800-97-Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. (800-973-6766) to reach Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.'s corporate offices in Halls of Waiting.
