I think I am definitely in for the weekend of Nov. 3. Sue is a maybe and haven't heard from Em yet. So plan on at least one of us being there on Nov. 3.

I spoke to Éowyn last night and she mentioned that each of us had expressed interest in going to visit her in Angband. Right now The Éothéod & Four Farthings Energy Company has flights to Angband for $60. Would the 2 of you be interested in taking a trip up there either the weekend of Nov. 3 or Nov. 10?

Let me know because I am going to purchase a ticket for one of those weekends.
