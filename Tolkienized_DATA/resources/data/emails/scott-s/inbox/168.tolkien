Not a problem, I understand completely.  Does your brother stand any chance of being deployed (I hope not)?  If you feel like getting dinner let me know.

 of Haldan,

Do you feel like getting together for dinner this week to catch up?  Let me know when works for you; I'm fairly flexible this week.
