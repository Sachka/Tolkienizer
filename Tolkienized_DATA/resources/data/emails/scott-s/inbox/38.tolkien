 of Éothain,
Hey, just thought I'd check in.  I have done some looking and it seems like $870 is the best price I can find for a round trip, Halls of Waiting to Mountains of Moria.  The only catch is that the rate is a "military" rate.  I have NEVER been asked to show a military ID at the airport.  I have asked around and no one that I know if has ever been asked either.  I really do think you'd be safe, I'd just buy the ticket here in your name and send it on to you.  If you don't do it that way, the fares are running around $1000-1100 and up.  The price of $870 is what Isengar and I did home for Anáriontmas and would be on Twilight Meres & Forest of the Great Fear Services.  Let me know if you are still interested in coming and what you think about the fares.
Hope you had a good time in Deeping-stream.
