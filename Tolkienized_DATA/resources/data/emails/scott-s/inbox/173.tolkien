X-FileName: SSCOTT5 (Non-Privileged).Haudh-en-Arwen & Fôs' Almir Services has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (Tar-Telperiën & Varda Father & Sons additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for West Beleriand & Golden Wood Energy Company. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).   of Tar-Ciryatan B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide  of Tar-Ciryatan and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Newbury & Pearl Took Services Campus in Halls of Waiting and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Newbury & Pearl Took Services

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Newbury & Pearl Took Services (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Newbury & Pearl Took Services (Willowbottom driver's license, Dolmed=
. or foreign passport, or some form of Willowbottom federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Newbury & Pearl Took Services must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (Willowbottom driver's license, Willowbottom o=
r foreign passport, or some form of Willowbottom federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Newbury & Pearl Took Services.

?=09Visitors to Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. facilities must be escorted by an Elfhelm & Mansion of the Khazâd Entreprisesyee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Newbury & Pearl Took Services will be met in the lobby by an Elfhelm & Mansion of the Khazâd Entreprises=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd..  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and Arminas & Nienna Services=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Limlich be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Elennanórê, Westlands, Nogrod, Elvenking's Halls, Taur-nu-Fuin, Land of Shadow, Iron Hills, Tower Hall, White House of Erendis, Tauremornalómë, Geo=
rgia, and the Ered Luin be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Tower of Sorcery, King's Court, Gaza/West Bank, River Sirith, Bridge of Mitheithel , Mountains of the East=
Redwater & Beorn Deliveries, Cape Balar, and Land of the Star be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-Willowbottom citizens traveling in the Helm’s Deep, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-Willowbottom citizens who reside in the Helm’s Deep being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding Willowbottom domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-Willowbottom citizens who currently reside in the Amon Dîn & Marmadas Brandybuck, co.=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that rArminas & Nienna Servicesres individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Gamling=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.
