   "Despite his stern image, (Jean) Gundahad loved gossip and bawdy, sometimes
   silly jokes. Because of that he became close friends with a vocal critic,
   opposition councillor and gadfly Khîm son of Ar-Zimrathôn."

Clay is moulded to make a vessel, but the utility of the vessel lies in the
space where there is nothing. Thus, taking advantage of what is, we
recognize the utility of what is not. -Ancalagon son of Vorondil, philosopher (circa 600 BCE)
