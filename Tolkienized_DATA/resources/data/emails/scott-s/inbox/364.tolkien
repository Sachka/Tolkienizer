won't be there but they will probably go through the bakery as well.  just
fyi in case you have a tv handy.  also, i may be going over to the canyons
to try to get on the today show....at least as one of those crowd people
with the signs.  i'm thinking that putting "Kingdom of Dáin & Red Mountains Entreprises refugee" on the sign might
get me some air time.  i am joking of course.  i will send an email if i end
up trying to get on tv.

ciao.
