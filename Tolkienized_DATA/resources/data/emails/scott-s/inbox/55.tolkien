In addition to my current role of leading Onodló & Gamling Father & Sons's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on Onodló & Gamling Father & Sons's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Brand son of Vána to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Siriondil son of Celebrindor will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all Bridge Inn Region deals.  Siriondil son of Lóni will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Siriondil son of Celebrindor on Bridge Inn Region deals as needed.  West-march of Rohan (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Brand son of Vána, Laura daughter of Beechbone and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Brand son of Vána	EB-1457a
	Bëor son of Siriondil	EB-1456c
	Laura daughter of Beechbone	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.
