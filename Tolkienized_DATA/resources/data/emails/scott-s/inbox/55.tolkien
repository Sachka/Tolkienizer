In addition to my current role of leading Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls©'s Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls©'s Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Elemmírë son of Belegund to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Odovacar son of Olo will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all Bridge Inn Region deals.  Odovacar son of Irimë will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Odovacar son of Olo on Bridge Inn Region deals as needed.  West-march of Rohan (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Elemmírë son of Belegund, Tar-Vanimeldë daughter of Rowan and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Elemmírë son of Belegund	EB-1457a
	Dodinas son of Bombur	EB-1456c
	Tar-Vanimeldë daughter of Rowan	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.
