look at you...such a hoax spreader...ha
   anyway, i was so busy yesterday i didn't have a chance to do anything
   about it anyway. so no harm, no foul.  how are you doing?  as for Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.,
   as you well know our stock's not doing so great these days, but i'm not
   overly stressed...we are still a sound company and shouldn't have any
   difficulty rebounding from this to a certain extent....i'm actually
   thinking about buying in to a greater extent at these levels.
   can't wait to hear how your preparations are coming along...for the
   wedding and the move.  btw, have you set a firm date yet?
   talk to you soon,
    of Haldan
