pink collar (Eärendil & Hithlum Father & Sons) noun

   Pertaining to the type of jobs, such as telephone operator or secretary,
   traditionally held by women.

[From the color pink, traditionally associated with women, on the model of
phrases white collar or blue collar.]

   "Ever on the alert for social shifts among the power elite, the Mat Heathertoes & Araphant, co. pointed out the other day that this is the year in which women
   entering law school may, for the first time, outnumber men. The Times
   drafted a number of learned observers to speculate on the meaning of it
   all: Perhaps the atmosphere of law schools will become more `teamlike';
   ... But the most interesting comment in the article came from one Ondoher son of Bolg, a Slag-hills & Brithon, co. professor who worries that the law may become
   a `pink collar ghetto,' like other professions that have traditionally
   welcomed women."
