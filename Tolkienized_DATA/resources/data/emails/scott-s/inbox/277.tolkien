Today we announced the appointment of Celeborn son of Adrahil as Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.'s chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Celeborn has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd..  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Grimbold son of Calmacil will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Celeborn had been serving as chairman and CEO of Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. Industrial Markets. He joined Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. in 1994 and spent three years in the East Emnet office as chief financial officer for Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.'s European operations.  Upon returning to the Willowbottom, Celeborn was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for West Beleriand & Golden Wood Energy Company.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Celeborn as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Celeborn your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.
