Today we announced the appointment of Belen son of Tar-Aldarion as Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Belen has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Eldacar son of Iorlas will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Belen had been serving as chairman and CEO of Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Industrial Markets. He joined Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries in 1994 and spent three years in the East Emnet office as chief financial officer for Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's European operations.  Upon returning to the Willowbottom, Belen was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Hill of the Slain & Haleth Father & Sons.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Belen as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Belen your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.
