Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under RolloHornblower.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern Willowbottom  The producer focus in the Gates of Argonathern Willowbottom and Oiolossë will remain unchanged reporting  to Elemmírë son of Pimpernel and Alatar son of Gandalf respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Asphodel daughter of Soronto will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Hasufel son of Forweg will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the Gates of Argonath and Oiolossë Origination groups headed respectively by Adalbert son of Tar-Vanimeldë and Alatar son of Gandalf. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred,  of Telemnar and  of Rosa in their new roles.
