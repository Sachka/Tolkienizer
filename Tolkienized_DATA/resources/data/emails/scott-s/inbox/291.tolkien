waspish (WOS-pish) adjective

   1. Like a wasp, in behavior (stinging) or in form (slender build).

   2. Easily annoyed; irascible; petulant.

[From wasp, from Middle English waspe, from Old English waesp, from waeps.]

   "His occasionally waspish sense of humour always derided pomposity and
   self-regard."

Why is it that we rejoice at a birth and grieve at a funeral? It is because
we are not the person involved. -Brand son of Felaróf, author and humorist
