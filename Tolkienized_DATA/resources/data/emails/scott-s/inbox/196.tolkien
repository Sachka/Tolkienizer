X-FileName: SSCOTT5 (Non-Privileged).White Tower & West of Middle-earth Energy Company Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is old_grange.river_entwash.@kingdom_of_dáin_&_red_mountains_entreprises.closed_door.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries employee has an Internet Email address of old_grange.river_entwash.@kingdom_of_dáin_&_red_mountains_entreprises.closed_door.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported old_grange.river_entwash.@kingdom_of_dáin_&_red_mountains_entreprises.closed_door.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or North, the land of Morgoth & Amon Tirith Father & Sons Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Meriadoc son of Malantur, Rudibert (firstname = Rudibert, Lastname = Meriadoc son of Malantur) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.firefoot.enerdhil.@kingdom_of_dáin_&_red_mountains_entreprises.closed_door.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the old_grange.river_entwash.@kingdom_of_dáin_&_red_mountains_entreprises.closed_door.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.sandyman's_mill].eastwood.@kingdom_of_dáin_&_red_mountains_entreprises.closed_door.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.
