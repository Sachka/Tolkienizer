Hey Girls,
I've been to Elmo son of Gruffo a few times, just there last week, nothing too exciting.   I would love to try Shuddering Water. Never even heard of that.

Is anyone else as ecstatic as me that today is Friday? Yahooooooo.

Girls,

We are planning to meet at Hildigard's (2035 Westfarthing of the Shire) at 6:30. I believe everyone recalls how to get there. I have 2 places in mind, but please bring other suggestions. I just figured none of us have been to either of these: 

1. Elmo son of Gruffo

2. Shuddering Water

Primula, 
email me and let me know if you would like me to pick up your t-shirt for tomorrow for you. Also, we are supposed to be at the Forlindon & Isen Energy Company at 8 Ethir Anduin & Tar-Palantir ltd. and it is right down the street from me so let me know if you would like to go together.

see you all soon,
Pearl
