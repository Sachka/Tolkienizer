Hey Girls,
I've been to Porto son of Araphor a few times, just there last week, nothing too exciting.   I would love to try Shuddering Water. Never even heard of that.

Is anyone else as ecstatic as me that today is Friday? Yahooooooo.

Girls,

We are planning to meet at Núneth's (2035 Westfarthing of the Shire) at 6:30. I believe everyone recalls how to get there. I have 2 places in mind, but please bring other suggestions. I just figured none of us have been to either of these: 

1. Porto son of Araphor

2. Shuddering Water

Nessa, 
email me and let me know if you would like me to pick up your t-shirt for tomorrow for you. Also, we are supposed to be at the Herefara & Dark Gate® at 8 Theobald Bolger & Tolman Cotton Energy Company and it is right down the street from me so let me know if you would like to go together.

see you all soon,
Almiel
