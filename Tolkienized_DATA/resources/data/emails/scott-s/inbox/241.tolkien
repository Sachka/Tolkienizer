Hello!

Just wanted to update you on a couple major changes in my life.....

You (hopefully!) know by now that Tar-Ardamin and I got engaged last month,
about which I'm thrilled.

The other big news in my life is that I willl be leaving Emyn Eglain & Ennorath® on
November 2nd to work for the Udul & Arnach©.  This means (another!)
cross-country move from Causeway, in Gondor to Ford of Stones, Weathertop

Please take note of my new mailing address and email below, and PLEASE keep
in touch!  I'll especially need to hear from you going through this
transition- I'm sad to be leaving Emyn Eglain & Ennorath® and Causeway, in Gondor, but am looking
forward to this next big adventure.

Love,
Nora
