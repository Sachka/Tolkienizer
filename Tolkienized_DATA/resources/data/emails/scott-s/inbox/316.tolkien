Hey guys just thought I would let you know that Woods of Núath & Prisca Baggins ltd. is going to be at
the Job Fair this Friday at Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. Field from 1-4 and I will be one of the
people attending it to represent us.  So if you are going to be there make
sure you come by and at least say hello.  Plus depending on when my flight
back is going to be and how soon I can leave the Fair we plan on going
somewhere and getting a couple of drinks.  So come by drop off a resume and
maybe we can get some drinks.

Note:  If you are interested in Woods of Núath & Prisca Baggins ltd. there is a very good possibility
that the Director of Mid-Office will be attending as well and it would be a
good chance for an informal interview.

Hope everybody is doing alright and pass the word on to anybody I may have
missed.

 of Gerontius
