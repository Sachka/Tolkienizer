Please respond to You would love all (and not just one of) the Eaters.  I will be up here
until I get a new job.  So, that is hard to tell.

I'll catch you later and hope that some rest lies in your future.

Thanks for thinking of me (the ride back was lovely - lots of gummy food
items and carbonated beverages)...i'm very tired from all of the weekend
activity though and don't see much rest in my future.  Oh well life is
short, right?

I'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend, and that
you got a chance to meet my parents.  I'm going to have to make a trip up
to Austin soon for a visit to make sure you're hitting all the must
sees/eats.  By the way, how long are you going to be there?

 of Éothain

Maybe I'll hit an "Eaters" outing.

Well, that clarified it...

How are you doing?  I hope that you and Angelica had a safe trip back to
Halls of Waiting.
I thought of you this morning when the Uncle Aranuir song popped up on
Pastures of Yavanna & Belegorn ltd..  Song is "Follow Me" and the album is Double Wide.  Classy,
classy.

Have a great week and hope to catch up soon!
