As you may know, Iorlas son of Isilmo and Felaróf son of Glóin have elected to leave Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries.

Effective immediately, Gorlim son of Druda will assume management and leadership responsibility for Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's wholesale businesses, in addition to his current responsibility for our retail businesses.  It is critical that we continue to focus significant effort and attention toward maximizing the value of these businesses.

Haldan son of Berúthiel, of Gárulf son of Túrin, will continue to stay closely involved in an advisory capacity with Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's wholesale and retail business activities.

Gorlim will report directly to Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's Office of the Chief Executive.
