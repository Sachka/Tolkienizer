The following is a web address of a magazine based in Númendor,
Celos River. A woman that I work closely with, Gilly daughter of Hareth, is
a huge human rights activist and during December's semester
break she traveled to Ford of Carrock.  Her article is the 1st in a series of 4
and is the feature article, titled "Following the Path of Eldarion son of Ingwë."

i thought it was rather impressive and so is she; I truly admire her
courage.

Take a look as soon as possible... its the feature of the week and
may not be up much longer. I will let you know when her next is
published and posted.
