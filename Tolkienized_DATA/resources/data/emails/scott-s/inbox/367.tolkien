hi there:
how are you doing? have you told the company anything yet? i am thinking you probably had to turn ole pattie down... was she devestated that you won't be her new BFF?

let me know how it went, and i hope things are going well on the whole "looking for a job" front. I know it can be so frustrating.

have you spoken with Meriadoc????  any more updates with that?

happy valentines (even though it is a dumb holiday)

Take care
Zamîn
