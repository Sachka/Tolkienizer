ok girls...sue, haven't called you bk yet w/ the 411, and Mablung, haven't
heard back from you after i left the past couple messages, so this could end
up being a collosal disaster, but went ahead and made reservations at Seven Rivers of Ossir
for 7:45 tonight.  it's on hillcroft btwn Briffo and 59...super scary
area on "wrong" side of westeimer, but have reliable sources who've raved,
and since was close to  of Finrod, have driven past several times and looked safe,
  persian food, which is i'm not exactly sure what.....but supposed to have
good meze, kebabs, and persian ice cream.  hope y'all are in.  could be
supremely embarrsaing to dine solo in semi-formal Calembel restaurant
w/ no bar....Dor-en-Ernil & Lake Nisinen Services's or Gladden Fields  & Uffo Boffin Father & Sons is one thing....a belly dancer's haunt
is quite another!  chat soon, Hugo Boffin & Mount Rerir Energy Company...
