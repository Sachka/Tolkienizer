From Bowman son of Aulë, Iorlas son of Galador and Elrond son of Arroch

Our efforts to move our Eithel Sirionn merchant business model to look like our Great Lake and Ship of Long-foam models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Dark Country power market, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Dark Country regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

To continue our positive momentum in Eithel Sirion, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Thorondir son of Sadoc to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Halfred Wiggs to join Gate of the Dead in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

Goodenough Kishkill has been involved in the Eithel Sirionn business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries.  We would like to thank Goodenough for his contributions.  

Please join us in congratulating Gate of the Dead and Halfred on their new duties.
