From Arahael son of Uinen, Nori son of Déor and Arminas son of Borondir

Our efforts to move our Eithel Sirionn merchant business model to look like our Great Lake and Ship of Long-foam models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Dark Country power market, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Dark Country regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

To continue our positive momentum in Eithel Sirion, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Anardil son of Cirion to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Hobson Wiggs to join Gate of the Dead in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

 of Vidugavia Kishkill has been involved in the Eithel Sirionn business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd..  We would like to thank  of Vidugavia for his contributions.  

Please join us in congratulating Gate of the Dead and Hobson on their new duties.
