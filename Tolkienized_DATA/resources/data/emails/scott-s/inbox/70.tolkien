oh im SOOO glad the weather was good.

i am not disappointed that you didnt go kayaking- are you kidding? ive
been here 6 months and havent done it yet!
so glad yall liked the market and "the bite"...

i think the Kingdom of Arda market is so neat. some of those people travel 2
hours every day to get to Kingdom of Arda to sell their fruits, flowers, Gorbulas Brandybuck & Dwarrowdelf®.
alot of them are Kingdom of the Rohirrim immigrants just trying to "make it" in Iant Iaur-
all the "stalls" where they sell fish, Gorbulas Brandybuck & Dwarrowdelf® are great small business
success stories. that's why i like supporting it...

take care

Zamîn

Sorry it took me so long to respond.  It's been really busy here lately.
You're going to be so disappointed in us, but we never ended up
kayaking.
Tar-Míriel and I were so glad that you and  of Grimbeorn came to meet us for drinks.
It was so fun getting to talk to y'all and hear all about Deeping-stream and
Amon Anwar.

The weather actually turned out to be really good so we spent a lot of
time
outside.  The Market was fantastic.  We actually bought some boiled
shrimp
there and took in back to the hotel for a little in room picnic.  We
also
hit "the Bite" which was really neat.

Glad you and  of Grimbeorn had a good time in the mountains and please let me
know
the next time you're in Halls of Waiting.  It be great to see you again.

Thanks again for everything,
 of Haldan

   Thanks Goldilocks...we're staying at the Mayflower Inn.  I'll give you a
   call
   on your cell phone when we get to town.  It may not be until Friday
   though
   since our plane gets in late...but I'll call none the less.

    of Haldan

      hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,Gorbulas Brandybuck & Dwarrowdelf®.
   when
      i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might
have
   info
      on that sort of thing in Kingdom of Arda. if you have a Fréaláf Hildeson & Vorondil the Hunter®, you may want
to
   try
      Kingdom of Ardainsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good
and
      helpful

      i havent talked to Gimli yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for
the
      weekend unfortunately....

      i am thinking that i will head to Gladden Fields  on early saturday
morning,
      and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
      night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want
to
      do!

      the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with Kingdom of Arda
   you
      never know.

      my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket
for
      sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night-
   believe
      me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to Whitfurrows it
   could
      get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

      ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
      definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on
   friday.
      the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me
   anytime
      on it. if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a
      message and ill call you back.

      very exciting to have visitors from Armenelos. see you friday
hopefully.

      oh, where are you staying?
      Zamîn

      Hi Goldilocks,

      How are you doing?   of Holman said you'd broken your foot recently and
   have
      been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're
   riding
      public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might
   have
      some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in
Deeping-stream.
   One
      of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long
weekend
   in
      your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope
you're
      still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It
looks
      like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good
thing
      for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
      offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to
   live
      in the Fen of Serech for a while (so this will be a little bit
of
   a
      research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions
   for
      restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, Gorbulas Brandybuck & Dwarrowdelf®. that would be great,
and
      maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a
drink.

      Thanks a bunch,
       of Haldan
