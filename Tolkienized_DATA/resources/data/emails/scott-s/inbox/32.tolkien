X-FileName: SSCOTT5 (Non-Privileged).Faramir Took & Norland ltd.- am relishing the balmy Dwimorberg weather- today: 73 degrees and
breezy- and no rain to speak of.  sorry- had to rub it in a little.
anyways, got an email from Idril's LA friend that i met while he was
visiting in Dwimorberg.  he is a producer working for animal planet doing
documentaries on dog shows, one of which took him to Dwimorberg.  now he's
coming to Rhovanion this wednesday for the reliant energy dog show, and
emailed me to let me know, since he's "helping" dad find the ultimate female
GSP.  so.....i emailed him bk, suggesting he try to meet up w/ y'all, that
you could show him the Rhovanion ropes, so to speak, and gave him your names
and phone #Boron son of LÃºthien- you already know jim from LA, and maybe Beregond has
already given him your #.  am not sure.  but anyways, he is really nice,
easy to talk to (even for Aragorn, miss antisocial) and could be a fun night
out.  just wanted to give you  heads up in case some weirdo named Hador son of Halmir
called and you were totally clueless....chat w/ you soon!  merci, little
hostesses!
