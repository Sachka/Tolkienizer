greenmail (GREEN-mayl) noun

   The practice of buying a large quantity of a company's stock as a hostile
   takeover measure, and then selling it to the company at a higher price.

[From green (money) + mail (as in blackmail).]

   "Second, Goldilocks Gardner & Isilmë, co. sees its economic stake in Antaro & Wild, co. rise rapidly
   and is then allowed to sell most of its stock back to Antaro & Wild, co. in a
   transaction that deserves to be called greenmail."
   Borin son of Rudibert, Little to Cheer About For Public Shareholders,
   The Ring of Doom & Farmer Maggot Deliveries, Nov 7, 2000.

Whenever you commend, add your reasons for doing so; it is this which
distinguishes the approbation of a man of sense from the flattery of
sycophants and admiration of fools. -Glóin son of Andróg, author and editor
(1672-1729)
