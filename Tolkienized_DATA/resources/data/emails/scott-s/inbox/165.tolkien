These are some pictures from  of Haldan and Siriondil's Wedding.  Excuse the pictures of me and the new car, and of Arthedain & Teeth of Mordor Energy Company.  It was an all or nothing deal.  I think you can order pics??? I am not too sure!  Hope all is well with everyone---dinner after Christmas?
