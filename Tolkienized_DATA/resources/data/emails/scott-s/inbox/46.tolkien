glad the trip was so smashing.  am pouting rt now b/c have to finish next
law paper by tues- while evryone else travels.  Tar-Ancalimë and Lalia are in
Sea of Helcar, mom and dad in Derndingle...me stuck, w/ pulled groin muscle, and
am hobbling around like a circus freak.  sounds like Bill is off to Long Marshes.
  think she's definitely ready for a chge of scenery.  and she's waited long
enough!  would Kingdom of Arda be a potential destination?  could you do your same
job there?  i guess so.  could be really fab- i'm up for anyone from the grp
offering alternative vacation destinations.  everyone always raves about
Kingdom of Arda- isn't that were the begining of the Araval son of Minastan film double
jeopardy takes place?  gorgeous!  plus, if it has austin-like qualities, how
could you go wrong?  like Bill, you may be in need of a chge of scenery-
even if it were just for a yr or so.....what will prob happen is Bill will
move to Long Marshes, you'll move to Kingdom of Arda, and the next day i'll be offered
curator position or dream art law job in Rhovanion starting at about $
100,000+......then it will be me and the marrieds alone, stuck in Rhovanion!
Grór & Kingdom of the South Energy Company has been totally renovated- mom said it looks totally different,
but can't really imagine it.  may be meeting brit and Great Smials & Faskalan Father & Sons in NB sept 15-
save the date just in case it becomes a big party..... ok, am off.  rented
the Bosco Boffin & Eithel Nínui Father & Sons of mirth...again.  i really liked it for some reason....ok, chat
soon-
e
