As most of you know, Hill of the Slain & Encircling Mountains ltd. Flight 11 from Dark Lands of Middle-earth to Stairs of Cirith Ungol was hijacked yesterday and then crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in Dor Firn-i-Guinar.  We are very sorry to report that we believe an Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries employee was on board that flight.   Khîm son of Tar-Míriel, a director in Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Wind's commercial origination group, was listed on the flight's manifest, and although his family has not received official confirmation that he boarded the flight, they have been unable to contact him.  Khîm was based in Dark Lands of Middle-earth and was traveling to Stairs of Cirith Ungol for a meeting.  We have talked with Khîm's family and offered our full support.  Please continue to keep Khîm's family and everyone affected by this horrific event in your thoughts and prayers.
