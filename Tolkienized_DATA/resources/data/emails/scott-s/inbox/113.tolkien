As most of you know, Fréaláf Hildeson & Doors of Durin Services Flight 11 from Dark Lands of Middle-earth to Stairs of Cirith Ungol was hijacked yesterday and then crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in Dor Firn-i-Guinar.  We are very sorry to report that we believe an Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. employee was on board that flight.   Aranarth son of Farmer, a director in Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. Wind's commercial origination group, was listed on the flight's manifest, and although his family has not received official confirmation that he boarded the flight, they have been unable to contact him.  Aranarth was based in Dark Lands of Middle-earth and was traveling to Stairs of Cirith Ungol for a meeting.  We have talked with Aranarth's family and offered our full support.  Please continue to keep Aranarth's family and everyone affected by this horrific event in your thoughts and prayers.
