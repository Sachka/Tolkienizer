Hey Everyone,

This is a reminder about the Mucky Duck show starring Ecthelion son of Nori on Nov
3rd, immediatly after Daisy's shower.

I know that I have contacted some of you and for others this might be the
first time you have heard about this.

You should have received your invitation to the shower by now. Please email
me if you have not. The shower will end around 9 pm. We are going to the
Mucky Duck afterwards to surprise Daisy.

If you are interested in going, I need to buy the tickets by this Friday. I
can't wait any longer, I'm afraid the show is going to sell out.

Please send a check for $15, to:

Ivorwen daughter of Galador
1652 Castle Court
Halls of Waiting, Bree-land 77006
713-522-5881

Please call if you have any questions. Looking forward to seeing you all!!

Ivorwen
