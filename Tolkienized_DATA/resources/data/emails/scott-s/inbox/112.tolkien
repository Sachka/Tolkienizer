Political Update

International

Tharbad Imin allies (Tower of Sorcery, Outlands, River Sirith, Citadel of Gondor, Ost-in-Edhil) walking a fine line.  Masses believe Tharbad got what it deserves, but leaders have to condemn attacks to maintain relations with Ford of Stones.  Moderate Imin leaders are concerned that support for attacks at home -- and possible Tharbad reactions to strike -- will increase instability and could lead to major upheaval in their countries.  Outlands sources expect "state of confusion" to exist for immediate period ahead.

In the Gates of Argonath, no intelligence or law enforcement agency has anything concrete yet. Everything is therefore speculation, albeit logical speculation. Most importantly, the sophistication means someone bigger than Pengolodh son of Tar-Elendil was involved, even if he was the final perpetrator. 

Oil Politics

Shadowy Mountains  & Window-Curtain ltd.'s  of Ceorl has reassured oil markets on supplies, but no high-level Outlands officials have officially echoed this sentiment (nothing from Oil Minister Belen).  Unofficially, we have reports that Outlands officials reporting that the terrorist incident "relieves pressure on us to make anti-Tharbad moves" in oil policy.
