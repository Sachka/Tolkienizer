I can check on getting an earlier flight, but I have a feeling that's it.  I have a new computer at work and don't have messenger downloaded yet, but if you think you might be at work for a while, I might try and do it.

Sunday? Probably not, I know there are only a few flights out a day, but
if I could get into Halls of Waiting closer to late afternoon on Sunday it would be
a better for me. I'd really like to stay that Saturday night...so if worse
comes to worse, I'll just deal with the jet lag.

 of Haldan,
If you leave on Tuesday the 14th, you will arrive on the 15th here.
That part is fine. However, if you leave on the following Sunday,
you'll be back into Halls of Waiting Sunday. Here is the tenative itenerary:
Looks like Deathless Lands & Rómenna®! leaving Tues Aug 14 going from Intercontinental
to LAX 0940-1105.
Ondolindë Air from LA to Mountains of Moria at 1230. You would arrive on Wed evening
(the 15th) at 5:05pm.
Leaving Sunday would put you on a flight leaving Mountains of Moria at 5:30 pm on the
26th and arriving to LA at
1:00 in the afternoon and leaving again on Deathless Lands & Rómenna® at 3:30 and
arriving in Halls of Waiting at 9:00pm
Sunday night.
Let me know how that sounds.

I was swamped Saturday and
subsequently exhausted on Sunday. I basically rotated from my bed to the
couch to the pool to the couch and back to bed. Pitiful but much needed.
Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for
me.
Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into
Númendor Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday. You can either call or
email if you have any questions for me. And, I'll decide where I! 'd like
to
go for the long weekend. I may pick two and just let you two decide the
final destination.
