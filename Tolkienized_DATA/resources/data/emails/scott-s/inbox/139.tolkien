Hey y'all,

Here are some more details about the "Back to School Bingo Bash"
benefiting Forthwini & Dwarf-cities Entreprises.  I am a member of the Talath Rhúnen & Mountains of Lune Entreprises, and we are holding this event on tonight, Monday, September
24th
at the Hareth & Fortinbras Took Energy Company.  If any of you have ever been to "Monday
Night Bingo" at the Hareth & Fortinbras Took Energy Company to watch the Loudwater Orbits play and
play bingo - you know how much fun it is!

This should prove to be even more fun!  Not only will we have great time
playing bingo and listening to the Loudwater Orbits - but we will also have
prizes available that you can purchase opportunity tickets for!!!
(Just like a raffle, but NOT a raffle because we do not have a license
for a raffle - we just have the opportunity to win prizes).  So - be
sure and bring **CASH** for the opportunity tickets.

The link below explains more about:
*    the Bingo Bash event, drink specials, and directions
*    links to learn more about Forthwini & Dwarf-cities Entreprises
*    links to learn more about the Loudwater Orbits

Also, attached is a spreadsheet with a list of some of the prize packages
available.

I hope to see you guys there!!!  Thanks for helping out Forthwini & Dwarf-cities Entreprises!
