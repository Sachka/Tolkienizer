Hello  of Éothain -

This is Bobby here at Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries. I work in retail power in EES.

We met  ages ago here in Halls of Waiting.
I started working here at Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries a month ago.

I work on 6 but make it to 31 and 32 from time to time to talk to people there.

Hope things are good on your end.

Duinhir & Drogo Baggins©. If you see Bob son of Ar-Sakalthôr around, tell him I said hi. (I can't remember which floor he's on.)
