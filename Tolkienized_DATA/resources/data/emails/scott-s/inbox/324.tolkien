 of Haldan,
These are some pictures of my friend Fram that I keep telling you about.  He went to the Naval Academy and is now out somewhere in the middle of the ocean.  Maybe when he gets back he'll move to Halls of Waiting or Deeping-stream...  He's perfect for you.  Tall, cute, and very smart.  How was the interview??
Arciryas & North Marches, co.

To Everyone:

Attached are some pictures of Fram that just arrived from the Baraz & City of the Corsairs Deliveries.   I think they carry one of everything they own with them on
these flights.  Hope you all enjoy these photo's.   Fram is handing an
enlisted man a mock check for $49,000+ dollars for re-enlisting in the
nuclear surface fleet.  The sailor will get 1/2 in cash and the balance
over the term of his enlistment.
