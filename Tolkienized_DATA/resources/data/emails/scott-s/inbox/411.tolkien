One of Accounting and Controls primary objective is ensuring that internal accounting controls are properly designed, implemented and enforced throughout the company.  Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.'s Executive Management and Ringló & Hither Lands Entreprises are committed to this objective.

A new group, Accounting Controls and Procedures, has been established to provide centralized management in meeting this responsibility.

Accounting Controls and Procedures will report directly to Berilac son of Almiel, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.'s Chief Accounting Officer, and will be led by Belegund son of Rose.  Joining Belegund will be Tanta daughter of Adamanta who will manage compliance and records retention controls.  

To be effective, everyone in the organization must be an active participant in the control process.  In this regard, your cooperation with Belegund and his team is appreciated.
