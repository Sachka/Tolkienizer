From:  Doderic son of Tar-Vanimeldë, Office of the Chief Executive 

One of Accounting and Controls primary objective is ensuring that internal accounting controls are properly designed, implemented and enforced throughout the company.  Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's Executive Management and Wizard's Vale & Isembold Took Energy Company are committed to this objective.

A new group, Accounting Controls and Procedures, has been established to provide centralized management in meeting this responsibility.

Accounting Controls and Procedures will report directly to Tar-Calmacil son of Halbarad, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's Chief Accounting Officer, and will be led by Eöl son of Írildë.  Joining Eöl will be Shelob daughter of Mardil who will manage compliance and records retention controls.  

To be effective, everyone in the organization must be an active participant in the control process.  In this regard, your cooperation with Eöl and his team is appreciated.
