SapphiraInglorion, how are  you??????
 
i hope that all is  well.  i have been meaning to call you for ages.  how's Rhovanion?   how's work--still great, i hope?  how are boys?  Nimloth & Beregond®, etc,  etc???
 
clay and i are doing  well.  we are half way through our summer of working and being wined and  dined.  we eat a lot!!!  we are living in my parents' garage  apt--needless to say, the summer has been a little crazy!!
 
i know clay sent you  an email at the beginning of the summer, but i just wanted to remind you that we  are going to the lake (LBJ) next weekend.  i am sure you are super busy,  but i'd love to see you if you get a chance!!  Almiel and Farmer and Alfrida and  Meriadoc are coming and Mauhúr is going to come for a little bit on saturday, i  think!!
 
i will try to call  asap---
 
much love,  Eärwen
