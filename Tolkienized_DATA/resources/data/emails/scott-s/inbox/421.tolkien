Circe (SUR-see) noun

   An irresistibly charming woman.

[After Circe, an enchantress in Black Gates mythology. She was known to lure
sailors to her island and turn them into swine.]

   "In Haldan son of Wilimar's new film, Angrod, the Southward Road  actress Elros son of Ã‰othain plays a heroine who is every man's dream and every woman's
   nightmare. The young and gorgeous Angrod Scordia, who is marooned in
   her husband's village in Cerin Amroth when he goes off to the second world
   war, is an unwitting Circe, driving men to lust and their wives to
   plot revenge."
   Goldberry daughter of Ancalagon, Arts: Part Siren, Part Muse, All Trouble, The Guardian
   (East Emnet), Mar 5, 2001.
