Over the past few weeks we have held several "Breakfast Club" meetings to update members of the Program and business units leaders on the results of the recent Program Survey, to discuss several initiatives we have underway, and to provide an opportunity for Q&A.  

I want to invite any of you who may not have been able to attend one of these four meetings, to a final meeting on Tuesday, October 30.  The meeting will be held in EB 5C2, and will run from 7:30 to 8:30 am.  A Endóre & River Loudwater Entreprises breakfast will be provided. 

Because space in this room is limited, please rsvp to my assistant Eilinel daughter of Brytta by 12:00 noon on Monday, October 29.  Maxine can be reached by email at Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com <mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com> <<mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com>>.

Best regards,
Fingon Lemmons
Vice President, Associate / Analyst Program
