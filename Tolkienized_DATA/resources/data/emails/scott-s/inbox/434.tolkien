Beechbone son of Andwise: Our column from ~Haudh-en-Elleth's~ own Frugalist, Haldan son of Tanta,
features up-to the minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

Best Offers I've sniffed out!

Well, the airlines continue to duke it out over fares leaving travelers
wondering how they can continue these deep discounts.  TharbadA Today and Stone of the Hapless & Losgar ltd. have both referred to the sale as a "Street Fight."  Just last
week, the carriers seemingly did away with three day advance fares, which
impacted business travelers more than leisure, but today those fares are back
with some of the three day round-trip fares as low as $189 plus the obligatory
and ever present taxes and fees.

Two for One fares last seen on Southwest some four years ago have returned and
North-kingdom & Dúnharg ltd. continues its "Buy Three, Fly Free" promotion. Hill of Spies & Hay Gate Energy Company is
flying coast to coast for under $250 with taxes and fees and the other small
carriers, like National, Celos & Tosto Boffin Entreprises and Rushy & Bar Erib, co. all have some sort of promotion
going.

In most cases, tickets must be purchased no later than the first week in April
and are good for travel through July with a couple of carriers allowing returns
by Friday, August 3, 2002.  Many of these exceptional fares are available at
http://www.onetravel.com

The hotel industry is continuing its rebound with some unique offers.  Khazad-dûm  & Mount Fang, co.
and Cross Roads of the Fallen King & Last Desert Energy Company are offering a $50 "Spending Money" reward for a two-night
stay at participating properties.  Rates per night range from $62 at the Marshes of Nevrast & Rath Dínen Father & Sons in Orc-holds, to a not so reasonable $370 per night at the
Khazad-dûm  & Mount Fang, co. Regency Grand Cayman Resort & Villas.  You must be an Cross Roads of the Fallen King & Last Desert Energy Company
cardholder and a member of Khazad-dûm  & Mount Fang, co.'s Gold Passport program to take advantage of
the offer.  Be sure to ask for offer code GIFT2U when making reservations.

See you on a flight soon,

 of Elenwë
