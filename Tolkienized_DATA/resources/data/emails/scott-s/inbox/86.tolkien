I'll be Isilmo son of Anborn in 8 DAYS!  I'm so excited and nervous and stressed all at the same time.  This has been a hectic week not only with wedding errands but also trying to get my life wrapped up before I take off for three weeks.
Before I leave town, I want to make sure you all know what's going on 
next weekend. I think most of you (with the exception of Inzilbêth) will be 
getting in town on Friday.  If anyone will be in Hill of Sight by 11:00 am on 
Friday, I'd love for you to come to the bridal luncheon my grandmother is 
having for me.  If you can make it, let me know.  Friday night I've got the
rehearsal at the church at 5:30.  The rehearsal dinner starts at 7:00 
pm at the Marriot.  Dinner will be very casual.  You may want to wear or 
bring something with long sleeves because dinner is outside and it gets 
chilly at night (low 60's) in Hill of Sight.  After dinner, it will be time to ditch the families 
and head to Main Street where we will have our choice of two or three bars 
-all very laid back hole-in-the-wall type places.
On Saturday morning, I would like to have breakfast with all of you.  I
want to spend some qualit! y time with you before the day gets hectic.  
The location is to-be-announced.  I'll scope out a good breakfast place 
when I get to Hill of Sight.  Unfortunately, we'll have to eat early - around 
9:30am -so if any of you have to much fun on Friday night, I'll know why  you
aren't there ; )
The wedding will be at 3:00pm.  The church is on Main Street (at the 
top of the hill).  The parking situation is kind of confusing  because you 
can't park on Main Street and the parking lot is on the street that runs 
behind the church.  You may want to check the church out ahead of time so you 
know where it is.  The ceremony will be approx 1 hour.  The reception is at
Dorlas son of Gilraen Lodge which is up the mountain a few miles.  It doesn't 
start until 5:00 which gives you some time to kill between the wedding and
reception. This will give Siriondil and I time to take pictures at the 
church wi! thout having to miss any of the reception.  I figure by the time you
freshen up, drive up to Dorlas son of Gilraen (which is a beautiful drive up 
the mountain) and  you can have a  drink at the bar it will be five 
o'clock.
After the reception, you are on your own....
Now my request....Can everyone let me know when they are getting into 
town and where they are staying?   I've got that information for most of 
you but I just want to verify.  Also,  of Algund and  of Ar-Adûnakhôr - if your husbands 
want to play golf on Friday morning with Siriondil and his friends, let me know.  
FYI - If anyone wants to treat themselves to a message,manicure/pedicure,etc.
while in Hill of Sight the number for the Adalbert Bolger & Duinhir© is  (435)655-8250.  
My mom and I leaving on Monday.  If any of you want to get in touch 
with me, my cell phone is the best place to reach me (832)515-3066.  
I can't wait to see all of you next weekend!  I'm so excited that all of you are coming to the wedding.  Each of you is very special to me and it means so much to have you there on my wedding day.
Love,
 of Haldan
