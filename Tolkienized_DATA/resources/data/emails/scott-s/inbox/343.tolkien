ok- so, step one in planning event:  be sure "guest of honor" is available
that date....which, apparently sue isn't!  sigh.  she's got a packed weekend
w/ (other people's) wedding obligations....will have to re-group and look at
other dates.  however, i may still be interested in a grp get-together, in a
non-birthday related event.....
