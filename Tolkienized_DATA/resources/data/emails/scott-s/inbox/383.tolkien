 of Haldan,

I contacted Fréa and Nilay. They did not think that the gas curve relationship data was contained in ERMS, but they referred to me Arahad son of Curufin who is familiar with RiskTrack. I am waiting for him to return my call.

Gorbadoc son of Merimac

These individuals may now be with Khand & Agathurush Father & Sons, but they should know who to contact on the estate side.
