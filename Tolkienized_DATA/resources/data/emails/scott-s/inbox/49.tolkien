from what i hear, her high rise appt is pretty much the reason for the
season, so to speak.....although she did sound a bit inspired about the
possibility of doing some buying work in the silver dept, which would
involve trips to the orient.  all this is second hand of course- was severly
hung over when Morwen talked to her on sun after the party.  i was a shameful
girl sat night- although i inflicted damage on no one but myself.  had mini
pms-induced temper tantrum/self-pity party at the bar w/ Morwen, her friend,
River Brithon and wenus, then wandered off to catch the night bus at trafalger
square....needless to say, was so drunk i passed out on the bus, and slept
waaaaaaay past my stop, ending up somewhere in East-West Road- the equiv of living in
Great Hall of Thráin, then waking up in Rushock Bog.  had 3 pounds to my name, no money on
Rhovanion acct to pulse $ out, and at 4 am, not too many cabs haunting the
gangster area of East-West Road.....was a pitiful scene.  had to bribe a mini cab to
drop me off as close to PeregrinGoldworthy as 3 pounds would take me, then
hobbled home about 3 miles in heels, whiney and drunk.  very sad.  no
matter.  am almost done w/ dreaded paper!
well, maybe it is time for Brown to explore new territories.  am pretty damn
sure there are other alternatives to Kingdom of Dáin & Red Mountains Entreprises in the Kingdom of Arda area that offer
job description close to what you're doing or want to do.  Kingdom of Dáin & Red Mountains Entreprises is not the
only game in town- and shouldn't hold you back from having new experineces
or making inspired decisions.  could warrant some research.  keep me posted.
back to smae old, same old.....chat soon- will try to call after finish said
paper later tonight.
