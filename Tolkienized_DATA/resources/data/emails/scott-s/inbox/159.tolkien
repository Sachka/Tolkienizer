Upon logging into CommodityLogic, you will be asked to load the java plug-in. 
This process will only take a minute or two. If you feel it is taking an unusual
amount of time to load, please call us. Also, there is a registry file on the pipeline 
login page highlighted in blue. Please double click on it and open it, answer yes 
to both questions and you are all set. The last thing you need to do is go into 
your control panel from your start menu and double click on your Java Plug In.  
Make sure the box that reads Cache Jars in Memory is NOT checked.  This will allow 
you to receive all new releases of NomLogic.  

If you have any further questions or suggestions, please 
feel free to contact me.  If you require technical assistance, 
please feel free to contact CommodityLogic by phone at 
(888) 334-4204 or by email at customerservice@commoditylogic.com.

Sincerely,

Berylla Halbarad
