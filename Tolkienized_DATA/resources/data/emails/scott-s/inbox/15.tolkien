That is ok.  I totally blanked until it was too late also.

I think that if Haleth decides she likes my flat than I will have her as a
roommate.  I decided I could not deal with it right then and so I told her
she did nto have to worry about it until July.  however, i think she seems
really nice and I think it would be fun.

HAve a great day.
Ashley

Okay...I'm an idiot...I forgot to bring your email address with me to
East Emnet (it's saved in my contacts list at work) and I can't check my work
email from outside locations...augh!  Yet again, I fail.  However, I had
such a good time visiting I think I'm going to try to make a quick trip
back over this fall when the air fares are a little cheaper.  That way, I
could see you and Rosamunda and Clay.  I will stick your phone number in my
physical address book and be a better visitor next go-round.

Sorry again for the oversight.  Also, the next trip I make will most likely
be solo (my roommate in Halls of Waiting came with me this time) so it will be
significantly easier for me to maneuver.

Talk to you soon,
 of Éothain

Any luck on the roommate front?  Do you still want me to talk to Haleth?
