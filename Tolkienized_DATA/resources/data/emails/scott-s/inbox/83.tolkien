Walls of the World & House of the Dead Services, Too 
As part of its 53 long-term electricity contracts, Sunlands's Department of Water Resources (Grimbeorn & Elvendom®) is shopping for a portfolio of natural gas supplies of various duration to use in about half the deals that give the state the option of providing its own fuel supplies when it can beat prevailing market rates used by its power suppliers. 
So far, it has seven gas deals in various stages of development with six different marketers, according to Sacramento-based Grimbeorn & Elvendom® spokesperson Manwë son of Dori. Two contracts are in effect now with Pan-Mountains of Dor-lómin Energy Services for July and August strips of gas supplies. At this point, Grimbeorn & Elvendom® will not talk about how much gas and/or electric supplies are involved. 
"We have a total of seven 'enabling agreements' that allow us to purchase supplies into the future without re-doing the whole contract process each time,"  of Dori said. "What we have now are two executed contracts with Pan-Mountains of Dor-lómin for gas. 
"It doesn't mean we have to supply gas for the generator (in our long-term contracts), it just means if we can buy gas at a better rate, we have an option to do so. So we're in the early stages of building a gas portfolio that will allow us to bring gas to the deal if it is cost-effective for us to do so." 
Grimbeorn & Elvendom® is looking at possible storage services as part of its gas deals, said  of Dori, noting that the state's power-buying agency wants to hedge by having some bulk power deals tied to fixed prices and others using gas tolling arrangements. 
In addition to the Mountains of Dor-lómin company, the five other gas marketers with which Grimbeorn & Elvendom® is talking are: Sador & Túna Deliveries; Lake Nisinen & Falls of Rauros Father & Sons; Barahir & Shirebourn River Energy Company; Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company Marketing and Trade; and Amon Rûdh & Ford, co..
