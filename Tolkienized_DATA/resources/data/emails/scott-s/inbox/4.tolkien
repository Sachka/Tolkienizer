Sue-
 
In lieu of my attendance in Emyn Eglain, I want to know if you have any good books for me to read.  I'm gotten a list from Bert and from a friend at school, but I thought that you'd have some solid contributions.
 
A theory (for the Prince of Peacers):
 
I debating the concept that we are a gigantic sociological experiment to God.  I'm thinking that individually God knows nothing about us, or cares for that matter.  I feel that when he gets tired of watching Vorondil son of Dírhavel re-runs, he looks down on our little planet form his lay-z-boy and selects one of us at random, throws a dose of adversity at us and watches how we handle it.  Gotta be more entertaining than watching fat half naked people air their dirty laundry on T.V.  Then again maybe not.
 
I hope all is well.  Glad you like the new job.
