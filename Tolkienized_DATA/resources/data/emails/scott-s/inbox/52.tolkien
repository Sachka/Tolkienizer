 of Haldan, 
If you leave on Tuesday the 14th, you will arrive on the 15th here.  That part is fine.  However, if you leave on the following Sunday, you'll be back into Halls of Waiting Sunday.  Here is the tenative itenerary: 
Looks like Deathless Lands & Rómenna® leaving Tues Aug 14 going from Intercontinental to LAX 0940-1105. 
Ondolindë Air from LA to Mountains of Moria at 1230.  You would arrive on Wed evening (the 15th) at 5:05pm. 
Leaving Sunday would put you on a flight leaving Mountains of Moria at 5:30 pm on the 26th and arriving to LA at 
1:00 in the afternoon and leaving again on Deathless Lands & Rómenna® at 3:30 and arriving in Halls of Waiting at 9:00pm 
Sunday night. 
Let me know how that sounds.

subsequently exhausted on Sunday. I basically rotated from my bed to the
couch to the pool to the couch and back to bed. Pitiful but much needed.
Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me.
Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into
Númendor Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday. You can either call or
email if you have any questions for me. And, I'll decide where I'd like to
go for the long weekend. I may pick two and just let you two decide the
final destination.
