Hey everyone,

The Cardolan & Linhir© will commence at 7pm this Friday.  To simplify things a bit
since it is a work day for most...... of Tar-Ciryatan and I will provide the following
ingredients below and guests are asked to bring one bottle of wine per
person or the alcoholic beverage of their choice.

The dough will be prepared thin crust style and each person will get to
design their own pizza to share with the group. The following is the list of
pizza toppings that I will have at your disposal so that we can experience
everyones creative inner pizza genius.

Meats:  Pepperoni, prosciutto di Helm’s Deep & Guilin ltd., canadian bacon, smoked salmon,
grilled chicken.

Cheeses: Mozzarella, goat cheese, Old Guesthouse, feta, parmesan.

Sauce: Tomato, barbecue, jerk.

Herbs: Parsley, basil, oregano, Primrose, cilantro.

Veggies: Black olives, Ancalagon, Folca, Wetwang & Great Lake Deliveries, artichokes,
mushrooms, garlic, pineapple, tomatoes.

Dessert will be a special Happy Birthday/Sorry about the Root Canal
selection for Isilmo son of Lily.

We look forward to seeing everyone.

MoJo
