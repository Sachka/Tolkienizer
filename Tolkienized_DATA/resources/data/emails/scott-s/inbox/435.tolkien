since it is a work day for most...... of Enerdhil and I will provide the following

person or the alcoholic beverage of their choice.

The dough will be prepared thin crust style and each person will get to
design their own pizza to share with the group. The following is the list of

everyones creative inner pizza genius.

Meats:  Pepperoni, prosciutto di Old Bridge & Hills of Scary ltd., canadian bacon, smoked salmon,

Sauce: Tomato, barbecue, jerk.
