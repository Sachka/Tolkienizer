Hey  of Éothain, long time no hear.  I hope things are going well with you.  I'm sure by now you're a star trader on the Realms in Exile.  I've been in East Emnet for the past 5 months in Kingdom of Dáin & Red Mountains Entreprises Credit (Troll-fells & Arveleg ltd.'s group).  I'm scheduled to return to Halls of Waiting next month.  I know I only call you when I need something, but I was wondering if I could ask you some questions about the market.  Is it ok if I call you later today?
