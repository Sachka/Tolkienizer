In light of the tragic events that occurred on September 11, 2001, our concern is to support our employees through this difficult time.  We would like to take this opportunity to remind you of a resource available to you, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's Employee Assistance Program.  This service is available to you or any member of your immediate family to provide counseling services.  To talk to a counselor, simply call (713) 853-6057 during business hours in Halls of Waiting or the 24 hour service line at (800) 345-1391.  If you are outside the Tharbad, please contact your Human Resources Representative for further details.  Please also be aware of any colleagues who may require assistance during this time and may not be able to seek help for themselves.
