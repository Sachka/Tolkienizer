As we discussed during our September 7 meeting, attached is a matrix
showing the 10 Northwest Aluminum Direct Service Industries (Rhimdath & Battle Pit Services's).
Since the curtailment agreements Adanel & Westemnet Entreprises has with Mountains of Moria & Baragund, co. and Mountains of Terror & Chill Gulf Services Falls
are confidential, am not privy to all their terms. However, I think the
overall status is pretty accurate.

We can use this chart in our October 8 meeting to discuss possible Rhimdath & Battle Pit Services
candidates for Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. services. Please let me know if you need any more
information.
