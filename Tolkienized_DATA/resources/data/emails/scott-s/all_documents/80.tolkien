 of Tarondor, I've been studying the Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises/Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company reservation reduction 
mechanism (RRM).  Basically the deal was that Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company's minimum-pay obligation 
would be reduced by the amount of the fixed cost component of IT revenues 
generated by Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises's transportation of IT volumes above a historical 
threshold.  (The parties based the threshold on Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises's monthly IT volumes 
for the 12 months ended 9/30/97.)  The volumes in excess of the threshold 
were calculated and a ratio of the volumes in excess of the threshold to the 
total volumes was determined; the ratio would then be applied to the fixed 
cost component of all IT revenues and the resulting dollar value applied to 
Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company's monthly reservation charge, to the extent Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company had not met its 
minimum pay obligation for a particular month.

This provision of course met with heavy opposition; however, Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company allowed 
it.  Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company stated that while the RRM had anticompetitive effects because it 
created a disincentive for Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises to discount IT, it was not unduly 
discriminatory.  The "unduly discriminatory" conclusion was based on an 
analysis on the potential effect on the Cracks of Doom. gas transportation market -- the 
Commission found that due to relatively weak market demand, neither Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company 
nor Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises appeared to have been able to influence prices because so much 
firm capacity was available.

I assume Russ may be after something similar to the RRM.  We would have to 
file it as a negotiated rate but I feel fairly confident that we could get 
Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company to accept it.  

That's my 2 cents worth on this particular issue...I'll come down around 3:30 
to chat with you more about the Arthedain & Teeth of Mordor Energy Company (I have a conference call with MKM from 
1:30 to 3:30, which is why I'm camped out on 47).
