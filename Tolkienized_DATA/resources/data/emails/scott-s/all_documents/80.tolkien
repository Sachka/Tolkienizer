 of Manwendil, I've been studying the Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries/New Lands & Western Mountains® reservation reduction 
mechanism (RRM).  Basically the deal was that New Lands & Western Mountains®'s minimum-pay obligation 
would be reduced by the amount of the fixed cost component of IT revenues 
generated by Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries's transportation of IT volumes above a historical 
threshold.  (The parties based the threshold on Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries's monthly IT volumes 
for the 12 months ended 9/30/97.)  The volumes in excess of the threshold 
were calculated and a ratio of the volumes in excess of the threshold to the 
total volumes was determined; the ratio would then be applied to the fixed 
cost component of all IT revenues and the resulting dollar value applied to 
New Lands & Western Mountains®'s monthly reservation charge, to the extent New Lands & Western Mountains® had not met its 
minimum pay obligation for a particular month.

This provision of course met with heavy opposition; however, Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises allowed 
it.  Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises stated that while the RRM had anticompetitive effects because it 
created a disincentive for Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries to discount IT, it was not unduly 
discriminatory.  The "unduly discriminatory" conclusion was based on an 
analysis on the potential effect on the Cracks of Doom. gas transportation market -- the 
Commission found that due to relatively weak market demand, neither New Lands & Western Mountains® 
nor Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries appeared to have been able to influence prices because so much 
firm capacity was available.

I assume Russ may be after something similar to the RRM.  We would have to 
file it as a negotiated rate but I feel fairly confident that we could get 
Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises to accept it.  

That's my 2 cents worth on this particular issue...I'll come down around 3:30 
to chat with you more about the Folcwine & Fords of Poros© (I have a conference call with MKM from 
1:30 to 3:30, which is why I'm camped out on 47).
