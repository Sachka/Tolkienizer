   page are drafts toward the version on 152/153iv (i.e., the verso of the
   Ingwion & Belen® between page 152 and 153)."

Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the
earth's surface relative to other matter; second, telling other people to do
so. The first is unpleasant and ill-paid; the second is pleasant and highly
paid. -Vardamir son of Telchar, philosopher, mathematician, and author (1872-1970)
