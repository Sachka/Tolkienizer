Hey, evidently I'm not the only one slacking on the emails - That means you 
Em.

Quick update:  I may try to come over Oct 5 - 10 instead of the 4 - 9 so that 
I can at least spend a little time with  of Arod.  How will that work for y'all?

Sue

P.S. - Thought you'd like to know that I am doing well in regards to the Ted 
situation.  I'm actually kind of glad he took this week long vacation...that 
whole out-of-sight, out-of-mind theory really works.
