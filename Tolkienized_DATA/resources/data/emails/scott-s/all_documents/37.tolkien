Boffin, see what Fíriel and  of Manwendil confirm and let me know.  I still think 
there is something related to our request for removal of the at-risk 
condition that has been filed which shows start and end dates.   of Éothain, can 
you pls. have someone check the CP90-2294 (Void Expansion) and Docket No. 
RP92-140 (Void Rate Proceeding) files on the 47th floor or have them 
copied and sent to me.   I think I would remember what the document looks 
like.   Thanks,  of Belegorn
