Hi  of Éothain,

In the attached file are the valuations on 11-1-00 for 11-1-00 for three GD 
deals,  using the tested version of PortCalc as we discussed. I did three 
deals out of the six deals you picked earlier-- basically they worked the 
same way. Let me know if you have any questions.

Shouan
