I know that you've already indicated that you will circulate a draft of the 
late-filed exhibit by Friday, but if you have a draft we could look at 
sooner, that would be great...Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's business people who need to look at it 
will be out at the beginning of next week.? Thanks.
