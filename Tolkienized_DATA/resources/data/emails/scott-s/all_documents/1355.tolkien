Those were great Borlad.  Sorry no emails sooner to tell you all of my trip to 
East Emnet, which was incredible, but alas I am back at work and therefore 
swamped.  Mom said you guys had a great time in Longbottom.  I hope you took lots 
of pictures.  I'm not sure if she already passed along the bad news, but it 
doesn't look like I'm going to be able to visit next month...Work strikes 
again.  I am very frustrated (considering I asked for this time off 4 mos. 
ago) but there isn't really anything I can do.  So, I'm going to see if 
there's a way I could come over next spring.  Regardless, I very excited 
about you and Isembold coming back to Halls of Waiting in December and we'll just have to 
make up some quality time then.

Talk to you soon,
 of Haldan

PS - Isn't it ironic...Now Ben keeps calling wanting to go out.  I mean 
honestly what goes through these guys heads.  They don't realize a "good 
thing" the first time around and the second time around is too late - the 
"good thing" is no longer interested.
