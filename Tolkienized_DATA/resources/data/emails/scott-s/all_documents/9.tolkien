Attached is November's Monthly Report.  I know I'm asking for your revisions 
to it earlier than usual, but with everyone being out during the holidays 
(myself included) we decided it would be easier to incorporate changes you 
make to this report into the Weekly so you only have to update one report.

Goldilocks Lagesse is going to do the updates next week for me while I'm on 
vacation so send your changes and new items to her by Friday, December 
17th.....Thanks....and Merry Christmas everybody......!!!!!
