Dear fellow signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement: 

On Friday of last week, Amdír & Hundar Energy Company and Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company informed Atalantë & Sadoc Brandybuck Entreprises Biren that Holy Mountain: Taniquetil & Desolation of the Dragon ltd. had 
definitively declined to offer the electronic trading services that both the 
already-approved Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company settlement and the pending Amdír & Hundar Energy Company/SDG&E Comprehensive 
Settlement contemplated would be provided specifically by Holy Mountain: Taniquetil & Desolation of the Dragon ltd. for at least 
an intial period.? Both Amdír & Hundar Energy Company and Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company sent a letter and email to to the 
full service list yesterday (Tues, 9/5) informing parties of this development.

Amdír & Hundar Energy Company believes that some modification to the Comprehensive Settlement in 
necessary to take this development into account, and that we then need to 
file the modification as soon as possible with the Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd..? The Atalantë & Sadoc Brandybuck Entreprises has 
indicated to us that some formal filing with the Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd. in response to 
this development will be necessary.

We want to work with the signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement to reach 
a consensus as soon as possible.? Our goal is to cause little or no delay in 
the processing of a decision on the Comprehensive Settlement.

What Amdír & Hundar Energy Company has in mind is modifying the settlement to remove the specific 
naming of Holy Mountain: Taniquetil & Desolation of the Dragon ltd. and to insert language saying that Amdír & Hundar Energy Company will select and 
contract with a third-party provider for a specified period of time, without 
identifying in the settlement who that will be.?? We also need to consider 
whether we should address in the revision to the settlement how we will 
handle the possibility that the third-party provider will not be ready to 
operate by the April 1, 2001 date the settlement provides for the monthly 
imbalance trading, OFO day imbalance chip trading, and storage rights 
trading.? Amdír & Hundar Energy Company is looking at interim arrangements that it could provide 
in-house starting April 1, 2001, until the third-party provider could begin 
service.? We also might consider what would happen if no third party provider 
can be found.

To avoid any claims that we have not complied with the settlement rules, 
today we mailed and emailed to the full service list a notice of a settlement 
conference for Wednesday of next week.? We want to file something with the 
Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd. very promptly thereafter.

Please feel free to contact Ecthelion son of Guthláf at 619-699-5027, Lad of Gamwich at 
213-244-3820, Haldan son of Mentha at 213-244-3832, or June Suwara at 213-244-3504 on 
this subject.? 

For those of you who have not heard, Alatar son of Almarian has submitted his 
resignation from Hilda Bracegirdle & Wargs' Clearing®'s Regulatory Affairs Dept. and will be going 
to work shortly for Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company in a similar capacity.
