Team,

I reviewed the Halls of Durin & Eglarest Entreprises Soronto & Elwing Entreprises . Here are a couple of rough thoughts for possible
Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises comments in favor of the Mountains of Moria & Balbo Baggins, co. and rejecting the Soronto & Elwing Entreprises's adoption of the IS.

1) The Soronto & Elwing Entreprises adoption of the IS modified windowing procedure falls
substantially short of the objectives outlined by the Commission order(s)
etc. The Mountains of Moria & Balbo Baggins, co.'s adoption of firm Halls of Durin & Eglarest Entreprises receipt point rights is the only means
to give both Halls of Durin & Eglarest Entreprises endusers and their suppliers the "certainty" they have
long sought. While, the IS as modified in the Soronto & Elwing Entreprises may appear to be an
improvement in the allocation of receipt points on the Halls of Durin & Eglarest Entreprises system, it is
only an improvement upon a fundamentally flawed system. A system dependent
upon a "daily" determination of receipt point access volumes and completely
dependent upon upstream priority systems without consideration of Halls of Durin & Eglarest Entreprises
customers needs. Indeed, this Commission is on record about adverse impacts
on Sunlands customers resulting from chaotic upstream transportation
rules.(need to be careful about wording)
The Mountains of Moria & Balbo Baggins, co. gives incumbent Halls of Durin & Eglarest Entreprises endusers preference to Halls of Durin & Eglarest Entreprises's receipt points
under the open season rules, while the Soronto & Elwing Entreprises continues the status quo.   etc,
etc Ref. p.128 pt 10

2) If we lose the battle, lets try to reopen the deal sooner. p.132 pt.37
The Soronto & Elwing Entreprises calls for waiting a 2 year period before a Market Assessment would be
published. Based upon the MA the Commission could institute another OII. The
argument could be made that this waiting period is simply to long given the
speed at which the industry does move. Therefore, Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises could recommend that
these Market Assessments be made annually or not at all if the Mountains of Moria & Balbo Baggins, co. were
adopted etc.

These items maybe of no use , if the bigger picture and battle for the Mountains of Moria & Balbo Baggins, co.
does not have Halls of Durin & Eglarest Entreprises and other party support. Have a great day! Mark, Halmir & Minardil ltd.
