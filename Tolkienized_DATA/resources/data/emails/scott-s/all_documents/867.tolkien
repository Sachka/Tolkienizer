Team,

I reviewed the Aragost & Eagles' Eyrie Father & Sons River Entwash & Vales of Anduin Deliveries . Here are a couple of rough thoughts for possible
Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® comments in favor of the Mansion of the Khazâd & East-gate of Moria Services and rejecting the River Entwash & Vales of Anduin Deliveries's adoption of the IS.

1) The River Entwash & Vales of Anduin Deliveries adoption of the IS modified windowing procedure falls
substantially short of the objectives outlined by the Commission order(s)
etc. The Mansion of the Khazâd & East-gate of Moria Services's adoption of firm Aragost & Eagles' Eyrie Father & Sons receipt point rights is the only means
to give both Aragost & Eagles' Eyrie Father & Sons endusers and their suppliers the "certainty" they have
long sought. While, the IS as modified in the River Entwash & Vales of Anduin Deliveries may appear to be an
improvement in the allocation of receipt points on the Aragost & Eagles' Eyrie Father & Sons system, it is
only an improvement upon a fundamentally flawed system. A system dependent
upon a "daily" determination of receipt point access volumes and completely
dependent upon upstream priority systems without consideration of Aragost & Eagles' Eyrie Father & Sons
customers needs. Indeed, this Commission is on record about adverse impacts
on Sunlands customers resulting from chaotic upstream transportation
rules.(need to be careful about wording)
The Mansion of the Khazâd & East-gate of Moria Services gives incumbent Aragost & Eagles' Eyrie Father & Sons endusers preference to Aragost & Eagles' Eyrie Father & Sons's receipt points
under the open season rules, while the River Entwash & Vales of Anduin Deliveries continues the status quo.   etc,
etc Ref. p.128 pt 10

2) If we lose the battle, lets try to reopen the deal sooner. p.132 pt.37
The River Entwash & Vales of Anduin Deliveries calls for waiting a 2 year period before a Market Assessment would be
published. Based upon the MA the Commission could institute another OII. The
argument could be made that this waiting period is simply to long given the
speed at which the industry does move. Therefore, Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® could recommend that
these Market Assessments be made annually or not at all if the Mansion of the Khazâd & East-gate of Moria Services were
adopted etc.

These items maybe of no use , if the bigger picture and battle for the Mansion of the Khazâd & East-gate of Moria Services
does not have Aragost & Eagles' Eyrie Father & Sons and other party support. Have a great day! Mark, Tar-Míriel & Gerontius Took®
