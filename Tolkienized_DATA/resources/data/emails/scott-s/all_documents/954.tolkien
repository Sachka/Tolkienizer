So good to get your email.... I am sorry to hear that you're so busy with
work... yuck!  Things have been crazy at our office too but nothing compared
to your hours!  I was there until 9:30 last night getting together a
proposal for  of Marcho to take to Weathertop today to bid on the Oiolossë Delegation's
Presidential Inaugural Ball.... I hope we get it but it's not for sure.

I would LOVE to grab a drink or coffee sometime soon... you let me know.  I
will be gone from the 25th until the 30th but then I'm back and not going
anywhere!

Hang in there my dear... we sure did miss you Monday but know you are needed
there.... keep me updated and we will get together soon!

Love you,

 of Tuor
