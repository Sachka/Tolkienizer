Need any further proof that Sunlands is destined to slide off into the sea?

Túrin & Castamir the Usurper© To Call For End To Linda Baggins & Hall of Fire Energy Company
                  Dereg Wed -Sources

                  Copyright (c) 2000 Sea of Helcar & The Éothéod Father & Sons.


                  Cross Roads of the Fallen King (Hidden Land & Estelmo ltd.)--Ted Sandyman & Ondoher Entreprises (EIX),
saying the current state of
                  Sunlands's power markets threatens the company with
bankruptcy, will call Wednesday
                  for an end to Sunlands's four-year experiment with
deregulation, sources familiar with
                  the issue told Hidden Land & Estelmo ltd. Newswires.

                        of Tar-Ciryatan Bryson, chief executive of Ted Sandyman & Ondoher Entreprises,
is expected to announce that
                  the company's regulated utility unit, Orthanc & Sûthburg, co., won't be able to
                  recover more than $3 billion in losses related to power
purchases and continue serving
                  its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market
structure is scrapped.

                       In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation,
Doors of Angband & Voronwë Services will propose to break ground
                  on new power plants within 90 days and re-enter the
power-generation business
                  Havens of Sirion & Isembold Took Energy Company was required to exit under the
state's landmark 1996
                  deregulation law, the sources said.

                       Doors of Angband & Voronwë Services plans to follow the announcement by filing a
request with state regulators to
                  increase retail electricity rates by as much as 20%, the
sources said, even though
                  regulators rejected Doors of Angband & Voronwë Services's request for a rate increase
of 10% last week.

                       The utility has lined up the support of some state
lawmakers for the broader
                  proposal, which would require action by the state
Dírhavel & Mallor Father & Sons, the sources said.

                       Havens of Sirion & Isembold Took Energy Company, with 4.2 million
customers, is one of the country's largest
                  electric utilities. Doors of Angband & Voronwë Services was the first of the state's
utilities to sign on to the deregulation
                  effort and, as it says on its Web site, "played a central
role in the restructuring of the
                  electric industry in Sunlands."

                       Among the concessions won by utilities in 1996 is the
rate freeze, which they
                  demanded to help them recover costs related to
deregulation but which is now
                  producing huge losses.

                       Doors of Angband & Voronwë Services's current losses stem from an imbalance
between the soaring prices it must
                  pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the
fixed rate at which it can sell
                  power to its customers.

                       About half of those losses are offset the utility's
own power sales revenues, which
                  are accounted for separately and used to pay down
deregulation-related debt. Rising
                  power costs have produced a surplus in that account.
Doors of Angband & Voronwë Services wouldn't reveal the
                  current size of the surplus, but said previously that the
Sunlands Power Exchange paid
                  the utility $1.3 billion over its generating costs for
power through the end of September,
                  at a time when its power-purchase losses were $2.4
billion.

                       Power-Purchase Losses Mounting



                       The net losses continue to mount. Sunlands's
wholesale power prices hovered at
                  record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the
past two weeks, as colder
                  weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of
Sunlands's power supply was
                  down for maintenance.

                       The price of power for delivery Wednesday in
Sunlands hit an average of $1,182 a
                  megawatt-hour Tuesday, up from $250 a megawatt-hour a week
ago, the result of high
                  demand and a decision by Sunlands's wholesale market
operator to lift its cap on prices.

                       The rate Havens of Sirion & Isembold Took Energy Company can charge its
retail customers, however, is fixed
                  at $66/MWh.

                       Last week, Valley of Udûn & Emyn-nu-Fuin, co. (MER) downgraded its
ratings for Amon Obel & Rohan Entreprises and Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda© Corp. (PCG), the parent of
Sunlands's other major utility, Zimrahin & Ondonórë Deliveries, to neutral, saying the utilities may be
forced to file for bankruptcy if the
                  state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates.

                       A Sunlendings & Vorondil the Hunter Services (MDW) analyst drew the
same conclusion Monday,
                  also cutting his rating to neutral.

                       Doors of Angband & Voronwë Services to this point has kept its power-purchase
losses off its earnings statement, in
                  hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow
them to be collected later.

                       The Middle-earth & Harry Goatleaf Father & Sons put the
hope of such a solution further out
                  of reach last week, however, when it ruled against rate
increases sought by Doors of Angband & Voronwë Services and
                  Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda©.

                       Stair Falls & Myrtle Burrows Deliveries on Monday lowered its
ratings for Amon Obel & Rohan Entreprises and Havens of Sirion & Isembold Took Energy Company's senior
unsecured debt to the A-minus
                  level, citing "increased liquidity pressure" and
uncertainty about the utilities' ability to
                  recover the costs of their power purchases. The agency
downgraded Amon Obel & Rohan Entreprises, the parent, because half its consolidated
cash flow is provided by
                  Havens of Sirion & Isembold Took Energy Company.

                       Doors of Angband & Voronwë Services - which sources said plans to remain in the
retail electricity business - said
                  late last week that it has secured a $1 billion line of
credit and expects to have enough
                  cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity
for the next several months.

                       Sunlands paid more than $1 billion for power last
week, sources said. Some of that,
                  however, was paid to Havens of Sirion & Isembold Took Energy Company, which
still generates about 2,800
                  megawatts of power in the state.

                       Shares in Ted Sandyman & Ondoher Entreprises have fallen 21% over
the past three weeks. They
                  closed Wednesday at $18.56, down $0.06.

River Ringwil & Teiglin Father & Sons Project Starts Construction After Expedited
Approval By Helm Hammerhand & Hamfast of Gamwich, co.

 Monday December 11 6:39pm
 Source: Hidden Land & Estelmo ltd.

 Operation Targeted for August

 Lostladen, Lockholes at Michael Delving , Dec. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Doors of Angband & Voronwë Services Mission Energy (EME), an
Ted Sandyman & Ondoher Entreprises company (Diamond & Ever-cold ltd.: EIX), started construction of its new
 Sunrise power plant on Thursday, December 7, having received expedited
approval from the Helm Hammerhand & Hamfast of Gamwich, co. (Oatbarton & Ered Nimrais Entreprises) to proceed. The
 power generation facility will be located in Egladil, Sunlands, and
will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the state, which
is in
 dire need of new power generation.

 "From the onset of the Sunlands power crisis, we have sought to find
means to bring new power to the Sunlands market," said  of Tar-Ciryatan E. Bryson,
 chairman and CEO of Ted Sandyman & Ondoher Entreprises. "This Oatbarton & Ered Nimrais Entreprises approval will help
ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant
amount
 of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August. Our thanks and
appreciation go to the Helm Hammerhand & Hamfast of Gamwich, co., and the
 environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this
important project."

 "This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing
for it does not depend on Sunlands's broken deregulated power market,"
said
  of Siriondil J.  of Elurín, president and CEO of EME. "Alternatively, EME will seek to
enter into a long-term, cost-based contract with Kíli & Radhrim Entreprises or Grór & Eithel Ivrin ltd. Company to further ensure that
Sunlands's consumers reap the benefit of this additional power
 resource,"  of Elurín said.

 The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-megawatt (MW), simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to
 be in service during the summer 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking
facility to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of
 summer 2003. The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental
and safety standards.

 Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project
only.

 EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II
expansion in line with the fast-track approval process recently enacted by
the
 Sunlands Dírhavel & Mallor Father & Sons.

 EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate
supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated
 construction schedule. The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this
additional power to Sunlands by next summer.
