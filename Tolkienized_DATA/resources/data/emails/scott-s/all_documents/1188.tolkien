December 12th is great for me! I love all those restaurants, expecially PF
Baggins's (we might even be able to reserve the captains table this far in
advance). Wait -  of Holman: do you like Long Wall food? i don't think you do.  Any
place sounds great to me and I love the idea of a girls gift exchange! Thanks
for planning this!  Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
Love, Ondoluncanando
