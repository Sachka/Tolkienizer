Aquarius - Horoscope

                                      Powerful forces are at work to 
challenge you on a new level of association.
                                      Travel may be part of the new game 
plan. Investigate the possibility of a move
                                      to a new locale. You might consider a 
home away from home as well. This is
                                      the time to express a latent talent or 
learn a new technique in relation to
                                      investments. You may have to work out 
some conflicts in a relationship,
                                      however. Don't let hurt feelings 
prevent you from making a new start.
