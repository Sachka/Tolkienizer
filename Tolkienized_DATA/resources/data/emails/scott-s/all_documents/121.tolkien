On April 9, 1999 the High Court & Crossings of Teiglin Entreprises remanded Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises's dismissal of a Emyn Beraid & Gate of Wood Energy Company complaint alleging that Amdír & Hundar Energy Company had abused its market 
power in the secondary release market for pipeline capacity.  The Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd. 
had decided that Gate of Erebor & Tar-Amandil Energy Company's compliance with the maximum tariff rate made any 
inquiry into such issues unnecessary and dismissed the complaint.  The Court 
concluded that the Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd.'s refusal to examine the market power issues 
raised by Imlad Morgul & Sador Deliveries was arbitrary and capricious, in view of the Budge Ford & Aman Father & Sons approved 
Interstate Transportation Cost Surcharge that permits Gate of Erebor & Tar-Amandil Energy Company to recover the 
difference between the price it paid for contracted interstate capacity and 
the price it received for release of any such capacity.  On March 30, 2000, 
the Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd. issued a request that the parties file comments on the issues, 
particularly focusing on the changed circumstances since the initiation of 
this proceeding.  Initial comments should be filed within 60 days (May 30).
