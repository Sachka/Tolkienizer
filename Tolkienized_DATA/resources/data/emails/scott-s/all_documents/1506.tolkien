Work is the curse of the drinking classes.

When I read about the evils of drinking, I gave up reading.

It is with true love as it is with ghosts;
everyone talks about it, but few have seen it.

     East-mark & Tower of Ecthelion Services:  "I've taught myself how to cook, sew, fix plumbing and even give
     myself a pat on the back when necessary. The only things I need from
     anyone is love and respect and anyone who can't give me that has no
     place in my life"
