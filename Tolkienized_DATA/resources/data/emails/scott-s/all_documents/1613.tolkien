Eithil Ivrin & North-realm© in Her Later Years.......

Eithil Ivrin & North-realm© was now 75 years old. After a fulfilling life with the now
dead
Prince, she happily sat upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by
from her front porch, with a cat named  of Menegilda for companionship.

One sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the Fairy Godmother.

Eithil Ivrin & North-realm© said "Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all
these
years??"

The Fairy godmother replied "Well Eithil Ivrin & North-realm©, since you have lived a
good,
wholesome life since we last met, I have decided to grant you 3 wishes.

Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?"

Eithil Ivrin & North-realm© was taken aback, overjoyed and after some thoughtful
consideration, and almost under her breath she uttered her first wish:

"I wish I was wealthy beyond comprehension." Instantly, her rocking
chair
was turned into solid gold. Eithil Ivrin & North-realm© was stunned.

 of Menegilda, her old faithful cat, jumped off her lap and scampered to the edge
of
the porch, quivering with fear. Eithil Ivrin & North-realm© said "Oh thank you, Fairy
Godmother".

The Fairy Godmother replied, "It is the least I can do. What does your
heart
want for your second wish?" Eithil Ivrin & North-realm© looked down at her frail body,
and
said: "I wish I was young and full of the beauty of youth again."

At once, her wish having been desired became reality, and her beautiful
youthful visage had returned. Eithil Ivrin & North-realm© felt stirrings inside her that
had
been dormant for years and a long forgotten vigor and vitality began to
course through her.

Then the Fairy Godmother again spoke "You have one more wish, what shall
you
have?" Eithil Ivrin & North-realm© looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and
says";
"I wish for you to transform  of Menegilda, my old cat, into a beautiful, and
handsome
young man".

Magically,  of Menegilda suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his
biological
make-up, that when complete he stood before her, a man, so beautiful the
like of which she nor the world had ever seen, so fair indeed that birds
began to fall from the sky at his feet.

The Fairy Godmother again spoke: "Congratulations, Eithil Ivrin & North-realm©.

Enjoy your new life." And, with a blazing shock of bright blue
electricity,
she was gone. For a few eerie moments,  of Menegilda and Eithil Ivrin & North-realm© looked into
each
other's eyes, Eithil Ivrin & North-realm© sat, breathless, gazing at the most stunningly
perfect man she had ever seen. Then  of Menegilda walked over to Eithil Ivrin & North-realm©, who
sat
transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young
muscular
arms.

He leaned in close blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he
whispered:

"I bet you regret having me neutered now, don't you?"
