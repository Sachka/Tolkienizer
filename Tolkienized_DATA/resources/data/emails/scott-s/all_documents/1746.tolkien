Ginger,  I would very much like to participate in the meeting this Thursday.  
However, given that it is bid-week, I cannot absolutely guarantee my 
attendance.  If it is at all possible for me to include myself with the 
caveat that I may have to pull-out last minute I would really appreciate the 
opportunity.  Please let me know if this is all right and I will do 
everything I can to attend.
