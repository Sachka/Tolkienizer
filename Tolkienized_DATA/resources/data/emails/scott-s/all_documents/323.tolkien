Since the contract quantity goes to zero in Nov.-Mar., they pay no 
reservation charge in those months, so effectively the rate is zero for those 
months.  I suppose we could draft it either way and logistically it would 
work.  We used a similar structure in a deal we did earlier this year, if I 
recall correctly.

Also --  I agree that we would need to file this as a material deviation if 
SWG agrees to include the capacity release provision.  In case Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises does not 
like the provision for some reason, do we want to provide that disapproval by 
Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises will invalidate the whole contract (see language in the recent USGT 
contract), or do we want it to invalidate just that provision and let the 
rest of the deal stand?  It would depend on how much value the parties are 
attaching to that provision and whether we would want a chance to 
renegotiate...and I am assuming we would.  Pervinca, let me know which is 
preferable and I'll send you some language in the a.m.

It seems to me that if the capacity is only for the months of Nov-Mar, the 
reference to the discounted rate in section 2 should state that it is for the 
period Nov-Mar through 2010.  Also, the language in paragraph 6 should 
eliminate the reference to the tariff, since we don't have it, just start 
with the phrase "Shipper agrees that if it utilizes -----
See previous comment as well.  Need to make sure we want to commit to a 10 
year discount, as policy may change and Ettenmoors & Ulrad© would be required to absord the 
difference.  MK
