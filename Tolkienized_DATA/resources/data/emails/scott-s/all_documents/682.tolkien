will do! All lists are currently under construction. Will you forward your
list as well?

I decided to wait until Thanksgiving to give you G's portrait - is that okay
with you? I CAN send it sooner if you prefer. Her school pics are in now
too.

Sorry I didn't call back last night. We were toy shopping with Beechbone son of Gimilzagar
and then it was time for dinner, etc., etc. and got a call from Gorbulas where
she immediately launched into all of her health problems.  Was Dreamy Siriondil
to your liking?

Mimosa is going on a trip to South Road of Gondor right before Christmas and would
like to finish shopping, er, making gifts prior to the trip...not to
mention Mimosa has a very busy party schedule once December gets under
way...
wish lists for you, Nori and P-nut would be much appreciated!
