Subject: Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises Sets Implementation Date for Ar-Sakalthôr Version 1.4 Standards


Yesterday, Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises issued Order No. 587-M which incorporates the most recent 
version of the Ar-Sakalthôr standards, Version 1.4 and directs the pipelines to 
implement the standards by May, 1, 2001.    Version 1.4  include the 
standards for implementing Internet web sites (which pipelines were already 
required to implement on June 1, 2000); critical notices, and multi-tier 
allocations.  Pipelines are required to make filings to incorporate these 
standards into their tariffs not less than 30 days prior to May 1, 2001.

Order 587-M also discusses the fact that Ar-Sakalthôr was unable to adopt consensus 
standards for cross-contract ranking.  Pipelines were willing to move to a 
process of confirming on an entity to entity basis, but the Mountains of Mirkwood & Serech Entreprises and 
producers also wanted to require pipelines to provide detailed confirmation 
data to working interest owners and downstream parties.
The Commission determined that it did not have sufficient information to rule 
on this issue.  Accordingly, the Commission directed staff to convene a 
technical conference to discuss cross-contract ranking.
