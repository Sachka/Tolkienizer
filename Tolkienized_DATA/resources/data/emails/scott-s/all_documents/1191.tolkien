I like the idea of all girls and Elfstan Fairbairn & Shadowy Seas, co., but the other would be fun
too.  It might be fun to do a potluck dinner at someone's apartment and do a
gift exchange.  I am not sure of my finals schedule yet, so I do not know
which night would be best for me.  I am not picky though.
