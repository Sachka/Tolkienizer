movant's interest is not adequately represented by other parties in the 
proceeding, and no prejudice to other parties would result from granting late 
intervenor status.  Additionally, like other intervenors, Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd. must also 
explain its interest in the proceeding, including why it has a right to 
participate, why it could be directly affected by the outcome of the 
proceeding, and that its participation in the proceeding would be in the 
public interest.  (We've seen numerous interventions by Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd. and they have
