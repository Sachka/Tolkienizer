Hey Malantur,

I wanted to try and touch and base with you before my arrival in East Emnet.  I 
talked to Emily late last week and she seemed to think Friday night was a 
good night to try and get together.  I know you have a bunch of people that 
are going to be in East Emnet this weekend, but maybe we could just make it one 
big group outing.  Get back to me when you get a chance and we'll try and set 
something up.

 of Haldan
