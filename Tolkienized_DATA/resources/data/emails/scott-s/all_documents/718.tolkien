That is by far the best line of the day!!  Unconscionability may be the thing 
I'm remembering, but I think there is some more specific law related to 
market dislocations--i.e., the Hurricane example.  Its sort of a twist on 
market power law--i.e., if the fates hand you short term market power, you 
better not use it.  DF

I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because 
they are "unconscionable."  There are several examples in consumer law and 
employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other 
is a Fiery Mountain voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none 
of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as 
Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® and Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd. or Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains 
struck at arms length.  
Pimpernel, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some 
looking, please let me know if you've found anything.

Subject: gouging

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.   of Îbal has asked Nár son of Sackville if 
Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cracks of Doom. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cracks of Doom about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the Budge Ford & Aman Father & Sons whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the Budge Ford & Aman Father & Sons or Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises or even Willowbottom Land of Gift & Uldor Deliveries to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Nár son of Îbal's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df
