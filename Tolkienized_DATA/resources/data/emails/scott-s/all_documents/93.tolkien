 of Tarondor:  here's what we would have to show Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company, along with some of my 
comments.  Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a 
draft to send around to the usual suspects.  

1.  Rate impact on Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises customers; method by which Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises would collect the costs 
of the acquired capacity.  

 -  I assume Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue 
associated with the Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to 
other shippers.  
 - Net costs will be separately recorded.

2.  Would acquisition of Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises capacity enable Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises to gain control over access 
to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises to 
limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to 
other pipeline services?  (I think Dina daughter of Shadowfax will be able to help us explain 
the "no tying" part).

3.  Would Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?  

 - No Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction
 - Acquisition of Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises capacity will not result in any undue preference or 
advantage to any affiliated entity.

4.  Will Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises's 
customers, to the detriment of Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises's customers?  

 - No.  Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises will be making the capacity available to Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises only during periods 
in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises 
shippers should be minimal.  
 - Service contract under Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises's tariff does not provide for unduly 
preferential treatment of Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises.

5.  How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's existing 
open access operations?  

 - Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises will enter into service agreements with Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises from time to time to 
transport gas on the portion of Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises's line from  of Treebeard, NM (i.e., the Sapphira Brockhouse & Cair Andros, co. operated by Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises) to Swanhaven, NM, where Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises's system interconnects with 
Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's mainline.  Resulting available capacity will be posted according to Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's 
tariff.  
 - The capacity will be used to serve customers under Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's FTS-1, LFT and ITS 
(right?) rate schedules from the  of Treebeard receipt point to delivery points on 
Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's system.  
 -  of Tarondor -- we need to discuss our arrangement with Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises -- Would we be 
able to acquire on an as-needed basis?  Would it be an ordinary service 
agreement as provided in their tariff?  Which would come first, our deal with 
Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises or with our shipper?  It might be good to come up with some examples of 
likely scenarios.

6.  Would acquisition of Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new 
facilities?  

 - Yes.  Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the Void 
Lateral.  Transwestern was unable to construct Void Phase II because of 
prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.  Using the 
Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises  of Treebeard to Swanhaven line is one of the few remaining alternatives 
available to Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises to expand this portion of its system.  It would enable Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises to 
transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the Void Basin to 
delivery points on the mainline of Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's system without the need for expanding 
the Void lateral.  The acquired capacity would benefit customers by 
effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's 
system, at minimal cost to Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises and no environmental disturbance.  Would enable 
both Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises and Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises to use their systems more efficiently.
