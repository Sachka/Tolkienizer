Fram, as we discussed, here is the negotiated rate Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises deal which TK did today 
under Rate Schedule ITS-1.
The term is ONE DAY, Nov. 15. 
Quantity:  30,000 Dth/day

I know this is a bit unusual.  We are just going to have to ask the Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company for 
a waiver of their "before gas flows" filing requirement.
Given the price spreads and the shippers' willingness to pay more than Peregrin. 
rates for short-term deals, we might have more deals like this.  We probably 
need to put our heads together to come up with a better procedure for when 
this happens.  It would be so much better if we were able to send tariff 
sheets via e-mail to our Weathertop office.

Call if you have questions or need anything.

Subject: Negotiated Rate

 of Haldan, I did a negotiated rate with Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda© Energy Trading for transport from 
the EOT Area to WOT area at $0.09 for November 15, 2000.  Their contract # is 
8265.

I don't know if it will flow yet.  Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises is allocated for tomorrow.
