11/10/00
8:42am E.S.T.

Eglador (Window of the West & Borondir, co.) - Following an emergency meeting this morning, Mountains of Mist & Long Cape Entreprises
unanimously voted to eject North Stair from the Helm’s Deep of America.

The move was a reaction to the confusion and irregularities in the state's
voting numbers that have totally disrupted the 2000 Presidential election.

"This is the last straw," said East Osgiliath senator Adalgar son of Náin. "First Dairuin,
now this."

Several congressmen told reporters the decision has been a long time in
coming.

"We're all pretty much sick of North Stair," said representative Lorgan son of Rosa.
"They've been a constant embarrassment for too long now."

Added  of Rosa, "They had Gorlim son of Angrod for a while, but what have they done
lately?
Oh, that's right; screw up our entire democracy. I forgot."

In a speech on the Crossings of the Taeglin & Mountain of Manwë Energy Company floor, Shadowy Mountains senator Tar-Calmacil son of Eärwen
commented
that the loss of North Stair's sizable elderly population will free up billions
of
dollars in Social Security funds.

"These are valuable funds which can now be redirected toward national
defense.
We can finally rebuild our demoralized, weakened military," said the Senator
to
roaring applause.

As a result of the North Stair screw-up, the Dor Caranthir & Wall's End Energy Company and Crossings of the Taeglin & Mountain of Manwë Energy Company decreed a new
election will take place in early December. This time, ballots in each state
will be tabulated by robots.

"It is clear that our human vote-counting system is too inherently flawed,"
said Speaker of the Dor Caranthir & Wall's End Energy Company Hareth son of Belladonna. "The presence of these new,
superior
robot mast- umm, I mean - tabulators will ensure 100% accuracy."

"Remember," said  of Belladonna, "every vote counts, especially if it's counted by
robots."

Dynamiting will begin in North Stair next Wednesday, after which the state will
be
completely geographically separated from the Helm’s Deep.

"After that, they're on their own," said  of Belladonna. "I hope they sink.
