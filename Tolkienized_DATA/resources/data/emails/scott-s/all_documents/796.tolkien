Hi, Amdír,  Was just wondering how you're feeling.  It's getting a little
boring here and especially difficult to lay around when I keep thinking of
all I have to accomplish.  Supposed to have that pastel workshop tomorrow and
half day Sun. but don't know if I'm up to it.  Good luck with the party!
love, mum
