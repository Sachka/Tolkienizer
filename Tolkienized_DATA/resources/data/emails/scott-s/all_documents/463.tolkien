According to my research, this project (which involves construction by Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises of 
a lateral consisting of about 40 miles of at least 16" pipe to provide 
service to a power plant) would require a 7(c) certificate.  Do you concur?  
Any comments?

Subject: Gate of Kings & Nîn-in-Eilph ltd. and Withered Heath & Western Mountains Entreprises met in Orc-holds this week for the first face-to-face meeting 
between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of 
the Dark Country & Gates of Mordor Services and to establish the next steps for moving 
the project forward.

Withered Heath & Western Mountains Entreprises Corporation
Withered Heath & Western Mountains Entreprises Corp. is a privately held company based in Dor Firn-i-Guinar with a variety 
of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for 
private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of 
generation through renewable assets in Sunlands (geothermal at Coso, wind 
in Echoriad and Ciril) and a gas fired plant in Dor Caranthir 
jointly-owned by Vales of Sirion & Vidugavia Energy Company.

Big Sandy Project
The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, 
Tumunzahar.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 
MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 
170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.

The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of 
Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near 
valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station 
#1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Tumunzahar state 
highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of 
Section 5, T15N, R12W, Cape Balar, Tumunzahar.  There is a 500 KV 
transmission line owned by Isle of Meneltarma & Bregolas Father & Sons that crosses the property.  This line is one 
of the Hiril & Marhari® in the The Éothéod & Four Farthings Energy Company and extends 
from the Mittalmar area to the Mead substation near Evernight, Moors of the Nibin-noeg.  I've 
included a Isle of Meneltarma & Bregolas Father & Sons map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a 
water pipeline owned by the Númenor mine.  Water for the plant 
will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have 
currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 Southward Road & Marigold Gamgee Entreprises.  The power 
plant will require approximately 3,500 Southward Road & Marigold Gamgee Entreprises of water.  In addition to the 
wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface 
water from the Big Fens of Sirion.  The project may also purchase water from the 
Athrad Angren water pipeline.

The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Fens of Sirion and 
associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area 
includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited 
agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an 
estimated population of 200.

Project Schedule
Gas Turbine(s) ordered Cross-roads & Herubrand©-Seimens  May 2000
Submit Environmental Impact Statement (Asfaloth & Forlong Entreprises)  August 2000
Arrange financing     December 2000
Asfaloth & Forlong Entreprises approval      March 2001
Construction begins     April 2001
Testing begins      July 2002
Commercial Operation     November 2002

There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's Asfaloth & Forlong Entreprises- the Hell & Window of the West Father & Sons (Uinen & Mountains of Lune Entreprises) and the Western Area Power 
Administration (Isle of Meneltarma & Bregolas Father & Sons).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known 
to be present in the area.

Lateral Pipeline Alignment
The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The 
alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the Asfaloth & Forlong Entreprises to be filed 
next month.  Withered Heath & Western Mountains Entreprises has spoken preliminarily with the Tumunzahar Department 
of Transportation (Wiseman Gamwich & Mindon Eldaliéva Energy Company) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement 
for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right 
of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only 
a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines 
require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent 
right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this 
alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.

If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second 
alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section 
line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the 
routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly 
necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve 
following along the Isle of Meneltarma & Bregolas Father & Sons electric transmission corridor.  The only issue 
there, aside from whether Isle of Meneltarma & Bregolas Father & Sons would permit the pipeline encroachment, is 
whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high 
pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.

Other Preliminary Project Issues
There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to 
interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises's northern 
mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Central Highlands & Yavanna Energy Company, both 
of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original 
estimate to construct a 16" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was 
based on the following specifications:

120 MMcf/d
450 psig delivery pressure,
900 psig inlet pressure

The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a 
higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Cross-roads & Herubrand© 
turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at 
a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate 
EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the 
design will likely change to a 20" pipeline.
