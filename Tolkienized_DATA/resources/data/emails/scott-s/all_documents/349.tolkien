I would expect that MithrellasTook will attend anyway to make sure we make 
good on our promise.

Assuming they are willing to withdraw their protest if we agree to this level 
of capacity, do they plan to attend the Tech. Conf.?

Cotman son of Mimosa and MithrellasTook of Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company say that they would probably 
(i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would 
amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can 
acquire from Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises to 20,000/day.  Their chief concern is to prevent Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises from 
becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never 
been our intention).   of Tarondor is discussing this with Amroth to see whether 
this is something we could live with.  The Commission has expressed the same 
concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our 
proposal too.  Comments?  let me know.
