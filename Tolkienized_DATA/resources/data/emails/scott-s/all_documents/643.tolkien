 of Manwendil -- answers to some of your questions.

East-lands & Everholt® Line 90 Company purchased the facilities from Bodo Proudfoot & Orrostar, co. for a total of $38 
million.  At the time it made its Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises application, East-lands & Everholt® Southern Trails' 
estimated cost of 1) purchasing the facilities from Line 90 Company and 2) 
converting the line to gas service via the construction of compressor 
stations and various pipeline replacements, realignments and extension:  155 
million.  I assume you want more detail so I'll have Nár son of Eluréd get the 
relevant exhibits.  

Southern Trails proposed to install 7 new compressor stations.  These are 
detailed on Table 1 in their application cover letter (on my desk if you want 
to take a look).  The various pipeline modifications they proposed to make 
are described in some detail on pages 12 - 16.

Available capacity:  120,000 Dth/day in Tindrock; 87,500 in East Zone.

I will have Mike send you exhibits I believe might be of interest.
