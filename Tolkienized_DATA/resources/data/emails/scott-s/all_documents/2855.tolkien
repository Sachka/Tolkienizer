You won't believe this... of Hob became obsessed with the idea of staying at 
the Proudfoot, so he booked one night there and one at Inland Sea of Helcar.  I told him OK, 
I guess I'm willing to stay at the Proudfoot, on the condition that we can 
have a party in our room on Saturday!!  Or at least invite you and Mark up 
for champagne!  I think this is hilarious!   of Hob is out of control!  He 
really is not the pretentious Proudfoot type.  I know you will like him.

I am staying over Sunday and leaving Monday for my meeting in Mountains of Mist.  
Unsure of  of Hob's departure plans at this point, but I'll let you know.

Hope you had a great weekend!
