Hi Mum!  I had a fun time this weekend.  It was good to have everyone 
together.  Glad K&J are relaxing about Gorbulas and the baby.  She gets such a 
kick out of seeing her.  Thanks for the new clothes; I still can't believe we 
let you shop for us on Mother's Day weekend!  

Got a message that Salvia came by and got the dishes.  Earlier when I was in a 
meeting she left a voice mail saying she wasn't sure what exit to use off of 
610.  Wish they lived closer and I could have just stopped by.

Had another sleepless night Sun. and finally took some Unisom and had a good 
night's sleep last night.  What a relief.  I have really never had this 
problem before.  It's good to have a lot of energy, but you have to shut down 
sometime.

Am sending you my travel schedule for next week.  The following week (May 29 
- June 2) I'm planning to be in SF also, but I'm not sure I'll actually have 
to be there that long.

Have a good afternoon!

Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz!  Hope you had a good trip back home yesterday.  I really do wish
Halls of Waiting were at least an hour closer.

Thank you for the beautiful pjs and robe and for the Sunday brunch.  I wish
Dina had been more help to you, but then, she never has been.  I really
appreciate all your work.

Good cartoon on the editorial page this a.m.:  Voronwë, the new Meduseld
president, was seated at his desk when an aide comes in and says, " Théoden son of Longo wants to know if you're related to BorlachVoronwë."

Narmacil and I went on an early morning walk and neither of us felt very well
and doubled back before reaching the bridge.  I think I was all tuckered out
from our Sun. walk.

The 3 of us were trying to get together for Narmacil's birthday lunch, so I'm
going to make lunch here on Sat.  Mairen is coming into town for a haircut and
K&J&G will be here since Dina has an appt. as well.  We usually go out to
lunch, but I don't want to miss any baby time!

I'm cleaning up the Dodinas Brandybuck & Heribald Bolger© from the weekend today.  Hope you have a good week.
 love, mum
