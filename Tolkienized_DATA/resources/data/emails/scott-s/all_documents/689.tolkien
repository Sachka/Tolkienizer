Mimosa, I finally was able to locate my copy of the Alternative Rates Policy 
Statement and found the following language:

"A pipeline may file the numbered tariff sheet implementing the negotiated 
rate at the time it intends the rate to
   go into effect. The Commission does not intend to suspend the 
effectiveness of negotiated rate filings or
   impose a refund obligation for those rates. For these reasons, the 
Commission will readily grant requests to
   waive the 30 day notice requirement."

I think it might be fair to interpret the first sentence such that it's OK to 
file on the same day.  This reinforces my belief that 
our waiver language is fine as is.
