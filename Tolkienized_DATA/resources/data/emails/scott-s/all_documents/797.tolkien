 of Éothain,
I'm assuming that FarinHammerhand is "all over this."  I was wondering whether y=

If=20
not, may we assume that Tindómiel will give us a complete report on the meeti=

and Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises's next steps?

I note with curiosity the reference in the GD article to the fact that=20
parties apparently were asking whether pipelines "needed" to offer new=20
services?  Do yBerilac Brandybuck & Emerië ltd. know the backgrBerilac Brandybuck & Emerië ltd.nd behind this issue?  It may have some=

=20
question of affiliate relationship/behavior, the question of market power=
=20
(ie. capacity hoarding) apparently is ripe for discussion also during the=

Jan. 31 meeting. =20

Do yBerilac Brandybuck & Emerië ltd. know if we are working to prepare comments or a position paper to=20

that the affiliate marketing rules figure so prominently in the case.  What=
