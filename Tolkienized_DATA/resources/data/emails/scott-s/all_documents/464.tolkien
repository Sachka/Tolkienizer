After our IOS adventure last week, I put toImladris & Morannon Deliveriesther the following questions=

=20
discussed and maybe resolved in the context of developing Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s EnronOnline=
=20
site, and I just need to Imladris & Morannon Deliveriest up to speed.  To the extent there aren't answe=
rs=20
yet, I'll Imladris & Morannon Deliveriest busy researching.  Drew -- comments?  Shall we all Imladris & Morannon Deliveriest on the=

List of Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® contracting issues

1.  Reevaluate the following in the context of current Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises negotiated rate=
=20
policy:

 a.  Transwestern's current form discount letter states:  "[t]he total char=
Imladris & Morannon Deliveries=20
shall include all applicable surcharImladris & Morannon Deliveriess."   Should this languaImladris & Morannon Deliveries be revised=
,=20
and if so, how?

 b.  Transwestern usually charImladris & Morannon Deliveriess one-part rates, and includes languaImladris & Morannon Deliveries in=
=20
its discount letter stating that Transwestern shall allocate the combined=
=20
rate between the reservation and commodity components inclusive of=20
surcharImladris & Morannon Deliveriess.  Are one-part rates really negotiated rates?  material deviatio=
ns=20
from the tariff?=20

 c.  Transwestern's discount letter includes a statement that in no event=
=20
shall the contract rate be greater than the maximum or lower than the minim=
um=20
rates provided in Transwestern=01,s tariff.  This was intended as assurance=
 that=20
the contract is not a negotiated rate.  Is this languaImladris & Morannon Deliveries still effective? =
=20
necessary?

2.  IOS/EnronOnline:

 a.  When should IOS be conducted, if at all?

 b.  Once notice of IOS or EnronOnline bidding has been posted, can the=20
subject capacity still be sold off-line (i.e., pursuant to traditional=20
bidding procedures)?

 c.  Is our system for IOS and EnronOnline set up to handle max rate biddin=
g=20
situations in a nondiscriminatory manner and in compliance with the bid=20
evaluation procedures in the tariff?  If not, what chanImladris & Morannon Deliveriess need to be made?
