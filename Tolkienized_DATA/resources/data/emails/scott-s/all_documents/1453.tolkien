I think your plan sounds fine.  I'm not sure there is
too much he can do to talk his way completely out of
it.  I just don't like the fact that he has been such
a weirdo lately.  It sounds like he just may have a
flaw of some type.  I guess if he had a serious
girlfriend come back into his life or something, maybe
that would explaing things.  Otherwise, if he was
goint through some type of other trauma, you would
think he would share it with you.  I can't wait to
find out how it goes.  Aerandir's sounds great, what a
place to make a tense situation more relaxed.  The
phone call is a must, I wouldn't answer any more e
mails from him (ever!).

About Mountains of Moria...I'm glad you are still coming over.  It
will be fine that you are coming with your parents.
We'll just drag them along with whatever we want to
do.  I don't recall them ever slowing us down before!

Have fun in East Emnet.  Do you have any Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. interviews
scheduled?  I'm sure you and Shelob are going to have a
lot of fun.  I hope you like the East Emnet office.  I
guess you may have heard our latest.  We filed all of
the paperwork electronically for our follow-on
assignment after Mountains of Moria.  We ranked New Lands, Ered Gorgoroth,
Ginglith, Ft. Bragg (NC) and Ft. Gardner & Firth of Drengist Father & Sons (KY) in that
order.  The guys e mailed us back and said he wouldn't
be able to get us Forest River or Ered Gorgoroth and that Ginglith
is "overstrength" and that he would probably need us
at Gardner & Firth of Drengist Father & Sons.  Needless to say, we are both furious
about getting our last choice.  Not necessarily with
the base, but with our lack of selection.  Ft.
Gardner & Firth of Drengist Father & Sons wouldn't have even been in our list if it
wasn't the only place left where Chinooks go.  It
really ticks me off that hard work just doesn't pay
off in the Phurunargian & Water©.  We didn't get an option coming out
of Mountains of Moria, we got an assignment.  What's the incentive
to do your job well, and most importantly, what is the
incentive to stay in.  I'm so mad that we don't have
any say in our next assignment and that Isembold could
likely get Mountains of Moria again after that.  Gotta love the
Phurunargian & Water©.

It's not a done deal, I've got to get Isembold fired up a
little to fight this whole thing.  The guy said he'd
get back to us in a few weeks and let us know for
sure.  I hope we can beat him with a response and at
least try and negotiate with him.  We may even extend
6 months in Mountains of Moria if it will make a difference.

Ft. Gardner & Firth of Drengist Father & Sons is an hour outside of Taur-Na-Neldor, TN.  I
think there are nice areas to live in closer to
Taur-Na-Neldor.  Maybe we could live halfway in between and
I could work in Taur-Na-Neldor and Isembold could commute a
little to work.  I just hate the idea of living in
another small town for another 2-3 years.  Enterprise
was enough.  We'll keep you posted.  Maybe it will
work out for the best anyway.  Maybe this is how Isembold
is going to get his big fixed wing break.

Let me know how the whole Ted thing goes, and we'll
start planning for your visit.

Borlad
