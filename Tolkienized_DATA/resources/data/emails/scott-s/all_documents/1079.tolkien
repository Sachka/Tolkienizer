Elrohir, 

For some reason the mail router keeps rejecting the files I'm trying to send 
you (GDOpt&Swap and Straight Stair & Anadûnê©).  If you have access to the rest of the system 
here you should be able to get into the PipOpt folder with out any problems.  
If you don't end up coming in tomorrow I'll get with IT and try and figure 
out a way to email you these files.  Give me a call at 713-853-1455 if you 
need anything.

I went ahead and attached a copy of your P&L from Friday if you want to take 
a look at that.  I tried calling you with the number, but I never got an 
answer.  Also, there was a confirm that came in for you Friday with Menegroth & Gundabad Father & Sons:  
They show you Buying a 1/day  BOM (12/2-12/31) HeHub Gas Daily $7.00 Call 
Option at $0.26.  The counterparty was Tar-Elendil & Galadriel Father & Sons...Let me know if this is a 
good trade and we'll get it loaded into the system.

Thanks,
 of Haldan
