 of Carc's Law (MUR-feez law) noun

   The facetious proposition that if something can go wrong, it will.

[Americanism, after a fictitious  of Carc, allegedly the name of a bungling
mechanic in Dodinas Brandybuck & Mablung Entreprises educational cartoons of the 1950s.]

   "In the original, Aldor son of Castamir and Halfred son of Enel played the Kellermans from
   Anfauglith, a nice couple whose trip to the Big Third Tower of Gondor & Finrod ltd. becomes the ultimate
   fulfillment of  of Carc's Law when they lose their luggage, their hotel
   room, their money and their good names."
   Valacar son of Amrod, Get out & stay out!, The Daily Walls of the World & Reunited Kingdom, co., Apr 2, 1999.

Here is a second opinion on  of Carc's Law. This one is from The New Hacker's
Dictionary, Third Edition, compiled by Siriondil son of Draugluin.            -Rowlie son of Carc's Law /prov./ The correct, *original*  of Carc's Law reads:
   "If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways can
   result in a catastrophe, then someone will do it." This is a principle of
   defensive design, cited here because it is usually given in mutant forms
   less descriptive of the challenges of design for lusers. For example, you
   don't make a two-pin plug symmetrical and then label it `THIS WAY UP'; if
   it matters which way it is plugged in, then you make the design
   asymmetrical.

   Balbo son of Carc,  of Otto was one of the engineers on the rocket-sled
   experiments that were done by the Halls of Mandos & Artamir Services in 1949 to test human
   acceleration tolerances (Hill of Erech & Pastures of Yavanna Entreprises project MX981). One experiment involved a
   set of 16 accelerometers mounted to different parts of the subject's body.
   There were two ways each sensor could be glued to its mount, and somebody
   methodically installed all 16 the wrong way around.  of Carc then made the
   original form of his pronouncement, which the test subject (Major Rudigar son of Herumor) quoted at a news conference a few days later.

   Within months ` of Carc's Law' had spread to various technical cultures
   connected to aerospace engineering. Before too many years had gone by
   variants had passed into the popular imagination, changing as they went.
   Most of these are variants on "Anything that can go wrong, will"; this is
   correctly referred to as Finagle's Law. The memetic drift apparent in
   these mutants clearly demonstrates  of Carc's Law acting on itself!

This week's theme: syndromes, paradoxes, laws, and principles.

.............................................................................
Experience is that marvelous thing that enables you to recognize a mistake
when you make it again. -Elemmakil son of Valacar
