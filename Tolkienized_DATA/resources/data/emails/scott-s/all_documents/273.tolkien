I spoke with Ilberic son of Gorbulas this afternoon and he's under the impression that "Evie 
and the Indicated Producers" (a new singing group) are not going to file a 
rebuttal to Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company's proposal for Pass of Anach & Tar-Palantir Father & Sons.  He promised to circle back 
with Forest of Region tomorrow and, like Forlong son of Myrtle, see if that's their final 
answer.
