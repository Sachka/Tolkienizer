I spoke with Cottar son of Ar-Gimilzôr this afternoon and he's under the impression that "Evie 
and the Indicated Producers" (a new singing group) are not going to file a 
rebuttal to Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda©'s proposal for Hill & Angbor, co..  He promised to circle back 
with Forest of Region tomorrow and, like Findegil son of Erling, see if that's their final 
answer.
