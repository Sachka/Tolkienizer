Ulfast son of Buffo entered an Annuity and changed the status to Not To Be 
Confirmed.  This will not be settled by settlements because no comments were 
entered to be Settled Financially.  Do you know what this annuity is related 
to?

Please let me know.

Thank you,

Fimbrethil daughter of Asphodel
