Hey  of Angelimar,

So he's back in town now...The question is what do I do about that?  Should 
I:  A) Completey ignore him and pretend like there was never anything between 
us or B) Call him out and confront him with his own cowardess.  I am 
completely torn on the issue and have actually felt physically ill over the 
situation the last two days.  Help!!!
