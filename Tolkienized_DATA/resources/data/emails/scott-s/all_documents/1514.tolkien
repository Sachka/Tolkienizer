Gardner,

The deal was done with one of the Sunlands Power Books.  We use the 
Oatbarton & Lugbúrz Deliveries/RISKMANTRA to book any deal with an Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries subsidiary...not just Mountains of Dor-lómin 
deals.  So, I don't think this deal has anything to do with the Celos River 
office.  Let me know if you need more information.

Subject: Cemendur Deal NK4420.1

Hi  of Éothain

I am trying to verify the liquidations for financial close and noted that 
Cemendur deal NK4420.1 entered by yourself
shows Oatbarton & Lugbúrz Deliveries (Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Celos River Corp) as the counterparty.

Here in Celos River, we do not to deals at NGI-PGE/CG and I do not believe that 
the book Ar-Adûnakhôr is a Mountains of Dor-lómin
book.  A review of the audit trial indicates that the counterparty used to be 
EPMI.  Is it possible it was changed by
mistake to Oatbarton & Lugbúrz Deliveries.

Can you please look into this deal first thing Monday morning as we need to 
book the liquidations Monday am for
financial close and let me know what you think about this deal.

Thanks for your help.

Gardner
