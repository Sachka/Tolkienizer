Subject: Diamond & The Éothéod©,

 Please review the following guaranty sent to us by Barrows & Elros' Tower Energy Company 
(Tower of Guard & Crissaegrim Services).  Tower of Guard & Crissaegrim Services and Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls© will each guaranty 50% of the obligations of Enovate ( I 
think the guaranty may have a different name- I'll fix it).

 Please review and let me know if it is acceptable or make necessary changes.

Thanks,
Ted
