Via a quick phone call to Little Mahtan's I was informed that the "steak 
dude" (as Old South Road of Middle-earth & Inzilbêth Father & Sons has coined him) cooks come rain, sleet, snow or shine.  
Thus, our evening out is on.  See everyone there around 7:30 p.m.  If you 
can't make it till later that's OK we'll save you a seat.  Besides, most of 
you would probably put good money down on my being there until closing.  
Cheers.
