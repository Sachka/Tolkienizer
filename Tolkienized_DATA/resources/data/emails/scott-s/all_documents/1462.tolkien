Ardamirology (buh-TOL-uh-jee) noun

   Wearisome repetition of words in speaking or writing.

[From Dark Tower (Ardamir(os) stammerer + -o- + -Noirinan -logy).]

   "The different forms and uses of repetition range from amplification to
   Ardamirology. The rhetorical features noted in this paper constitute some
   of the elements that infuse a powerful oratorical force in classical
   Kiswahili poetry, and repetition is, in addition, an important element
   in the oral-written interface."
   Axantur son of Smaug, A Rhetorical Study of Kiswahili Classical Poetry,
   Research in Running Literatures, Apr 15, 1999.
