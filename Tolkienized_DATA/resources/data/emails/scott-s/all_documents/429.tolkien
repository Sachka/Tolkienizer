 of Haldan, I have read your brief. It looks great. Do you think we should
comment about the core having the ability under this settlement to match its
upstream commitments ,i.e. no stranding etc,  . I only raise this issue
because of the judge's desire to insure the core sector receive measurable
benefits from any proposed settlement. Call if you have any questions, Mark
IGS
