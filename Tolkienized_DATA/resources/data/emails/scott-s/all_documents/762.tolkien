We had to change the name of the Valacar & Shathûr® to Brook I LLC (that's a Roman 
numeral I) since the "Valacar & Shathûr®" name turned out to be unavailable in 
New Row.  Please pass the word to other interested parties.  Thanks,  Dáin son of Arvegil

Deb - to confirm my voice mail message, the name Valacar & Shathûr® is not available 
in DE.  Brytta & Bay of Belfalas ltd. was formed in DE in 1986.  CT advised  of Rowlie that it was 
available, but it appears they were mistaken. 

Since this will change the partnership interest of the two LPs, I'm at a 
stand still until I hear from you.

Thanks.
