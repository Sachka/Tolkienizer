We had to change the name of the Northern Mirkwood & North-way Services to Brook I LLC (that's a Roman 
numeral I) since the "Northern Mirkwood & North-way Services" name turned out to be unavailable in 
New Row.  Please pass the word to other interested parties.  Thanks,  Banks son of Findegil
Bereth & Far West®.

Deb - to confirm my voice mail message, the name Northern Mirkwood & North-way Services is not available 
in DE.  Firth of Drengist & Ecthelion ltd. was formed in DE in 1986.  CT advised  of Merimas that it was 
available, but it appears they were mistaken. 

Since this will change the partnership interest of the two LPs, I'm at a 
stand still until I hear from you.

Thanks.
