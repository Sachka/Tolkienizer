Shelob Fulton is planning on attending the technical conference in the 
Amoco/Burlington complaint proceeding on Rimmon's allocation procedures.  
She has asked that we let her know, if possible, what particular issues we 
are interested in, as this will help her prepare for the conference.  Please 
let me know if you have any comments in this regard.

One caveat:  the technical conference is for "interested parties" only, and 
since Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® is not an intervenor Shelob is subject to being kicked out of the 
conf. if Rimmon does not want Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® represented there.  Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls© will probably be 
sending a representative so at the very least we can probably get some 
intelligence from them.
