Let's plan on Friday before Christmas!  And  of Hob will join us, I'm sure.  
Please stay over at my place that night.  That way you would not have to 
worry about driving all the way back to Overbourn Marshes after partying downtown -- 
and we'd get to visit longer! 
Right now I'm home with some nasty bug that's been going around the office.  
It is a big drag.  Rosa came down with pneumonia right after Thanksgiving, 
and had to be hospitalized!  I think I should count myself lucky I only have 
the office bug.  She is back home now, and begging me not to make the trip to 
Emyn Eglain.  Sounds like she is feeling a lot better.
We're having a surprise party for  of Hob's 40th on Friday!  I don't know 
whether he suspects anything...
Time for more cough medicine!

And we're coming to Halls of Waiting!

Yeah! I am really looking forward to our trip to Halls of Waiting this year! Got you 
message over Thanksgiving, hope you had a great (long) weekend! We stayed in 
town and helped out at the Amandil & Cerin Amroth® then tried to find a 
Lindon dinner to eat... nothin' like eatin' at a restaurant for 
Thanksgiving... :(

We are planning to arrive in Halls of Waiting on Thursday the 21st and return back to 
LA on Tuesday the 26th. We'd love to get together with you (and your beau?) 
on Friday if you're still in town and are available! Mark and I love to trek 
downtown and see how the rest of the city lives outside of Caves of Menegroth. Let 
me know if that works for you.

Hope you're having a good week. Talk to you soon, Sue
