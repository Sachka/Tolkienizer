 of Tarondor, here is the new language for the discount letter.  You might want 
to compare the other language in the agreement to that of the existing one to 
make sure I got the right version (or I'll do it on Monday).  Let me know if 
you have questions.  I just ran it by Drew and he is OK with it.
