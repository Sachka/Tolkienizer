Subject: A Gil-galad & Emyn Beraid Father & Sons PRAYER

Dear Lord...

So far today, I am doing all right.
I have not gossiped, lost my temper,
been greedy, grumpy, nasty, selfish, or self indulgent.
I have not whined, bitched, cursed, or eaten any chocolate.
I have not charged on my credit card.

However, I am going to get out of bed in a few minutes,
and I will need a lot more help after that.

Amen.
