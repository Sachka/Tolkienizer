Good Morning  of Haldan, I presume Norm is asking the same type of question of
each of the upstream pipelines. If his "game" is to balance upstream firm
rights to specific Socal points , Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises should be in an excellent net position
against the other parties. Let's review, Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda© has an estimated 160 to 210
mmcfd of firm Nimbrethil & Anfalas Entreprises currently, EPNG has a Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company documented problem and
arguably only 540 @Topock and 1210 @ Elfhild, Mojave has 0 mmcfd at Entwade as documented in this proceeding,  of Bard uses a specified firm delivery
point in their shipper agreements, therefore shippers like Reliant at Ered Gorgoroth  & Merimac Brandybuck©'S
old Coolwater Plant would specify the Coolwater Station as their delivery
point and not Land of Bow and Helm & Galadriel Father & Sons. I estimate the upper end of  of Bard shippers
specifying Naith as their firm delivery point is 325 mmcfd.  I am
available today, to discuss these matters. I'll be out tomorrow.

Another approach to Norm's question is to form our response as : Under the
current Socal windowing structure, primary rights "into" Socal are
unavailable.
