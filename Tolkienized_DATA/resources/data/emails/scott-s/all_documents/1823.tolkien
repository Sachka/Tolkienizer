You crack me up.  I was going to email you today and tell you about the Rollo son of Anborn concert.  I am definitely interested.  Don't know what I'm doing 
this weekend, nothing scheduled as of yet so let's try and do something.  
Yes, I am interested in chipping in on a gift, just let me know what and how 
much.  I've heard that I-10 Chronicles CD is really good, I'll have to check 
it out.  Also, do you have Doderic son of Baldor's Crusades of the Restless 
Knights?  Every cut I hear from it on Amon Gwareth & Tar-Ciryatan Deliveries is so good.  Sorry so short with 
the email.  Even though they may be short I should be able to email 
throughout the day.

Subject: wedding gift....


... hey you, are you interested in going in on a gift for Rosamunda and Clay
from Dished from the Past?  We want to get them something nicer that costs a
little more... Sapphira and  of Niënor and I are going in together so far...

It was so good to see you last night although when we're in groups like that
I feel like I don't really get to hear SCOOP... did you end up going to
Celeborn's?

I heard on Amon Gwareth & Tar-Ciryatan Deliveries this mornig that Rollo son of Khamûl is coming to Aerial Theatre
May 11th and that would be an awesome concert too... we may have to go to
that one too!  He sings "Last Night of the World" and then this amazing song
that was on around 7:40 this morning that you may have heard... so good!  Oh
my goodness  of Éothain, I forgot to tell you about this new cd I bought
Wednesday... The I-10 Chronicles... I heard about it on Amon Gwareth & Tar-Ciryatan Deliveries and it is
awesome!!! It's a compilation cd with Glorfindel son of Tar-Aldarion, Gundahar son of Myrtle, Guthláf son of Rúmil
and more... you of all people would love it! :o)

Okay, now that I've filled you in on all I have for now... let me know what
you're up to this weekend...maybe we can veg together...

Happy Friday!
