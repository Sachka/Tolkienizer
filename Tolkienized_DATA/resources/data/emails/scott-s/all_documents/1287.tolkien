Thanks Inzilbêth.  

I went ahead and made the counterparty name change so that it will be 
properly reflected next month.

 of Éothain,
I believe deal NK7690 is a Folcwine & Fords of Poros© deal, and not Baraz.  At least that is what 
Cemendur shows.  Would you please update your sheet to reflect the change for 
next month.  
Thanks so much,
Reginard son of Eorl
