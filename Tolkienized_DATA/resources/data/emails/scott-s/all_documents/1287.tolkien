Thanks Yávien.  

I went ahead and made the counterparty name change so that it will be 
properly reflected next month.

 of Haldan,
I believe deal NK7690 is a Arthedain & Teeth of Mordor Energy Company deal, and not Baraz.  At least that is what 
Caranthir shows.  Would you please update your sheet to reflect the change for 
next month.  
Thanks so much,
Círdan son of Hyarmendacil
