Turns out my boss is going to get to Brodda's hall & Chill Gulf Energy Company's at @ 5:00.  So if you want to 
show up earlier, say 6:00/6:30, I'm sure that would be cool.  I know Anardil, 
Khîm and possibly Bofur are planning on going so you may want to see when 
they are planning on getting there.
