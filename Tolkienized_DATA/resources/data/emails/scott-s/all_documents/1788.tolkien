 of Cemendur, my most heartfelt apologies.  I failed to include you on the last 
email (huge oversite on my part).

Subject: Let's get ready to rumble...

Via a quick phone call to Little Atanatar's I was informed that the "steak 
dude" (as Edge of the Wild & River Thalos Services has coined him) cooks come rain, sleet, snow or shine.  
Thus, our evening out is on.  See everyone there around 7:30 p.m.  If you 
can't make it till later that's OK we'll save you a seat.  Besides, most of 
you would probably put good money down on my being there until closing.  
Cheers.

As far a the girls go...I'm afraid I will only be bringing myself.  You know 
these Oiolossë girls, all my friends are either married, engaged or about to be 
engaged.
