I've reviewed the Halmir & Minardil ltd. market development agreement pursuant to your request.  
It expires 2/29/00.  The agreement requires the parties to meet 90 days prior 
to that date for the purpose of discussing an extension but does not obligate 
us to agree to any such extension.  

As you know, I have a conflict tomorrow at 10, but would be happy to provide 
any other information you need for the meeting.
