Hi  of Éothain.

Sorry I didn't respond to your email yesterday.  I opened it in between
classes, but never got back to my comouter and was out eating with a firm
until 11:00.  I will be glad when all of this is over.

The jury is split on what you should do.  Knowing myself, I would want to
know what happened...  i.e. what's the matter with him?  I think I would ask
him-- in a non-confrontational-- almost joking way-- like I didn't really
care either way but was just wondering-- why he stopped calling, etc.  I say
that, but I have never done that before, so I don't really know if that is
what I wish I would do, or if that really is what I would do-- and this has
happened to me lots of times.  Usually, I just write the guy off as gay or
stupid...

 of Elmo (and though I haven't talked to my mom, I know she would agree) says
not to give him any satisfaction of knowing you care.  Just act pleasant and
normal as if nothing has happened and is if you were actually the one who
stopped the contact-- maybe he thinks you were, you never know.  I think
this is a good tactic if you are sure your curiosity and need to tell him
off won't eat at you.

Actually, in practice, I usually combine these tactics.  Remember when
Fíli son of Arvedui was so rude to me freshman year?  First I called him and
told him off ( of Telemnar made me), then I ignored him (pleasantly, though)for
about four months until he couldn't stand it and started asking  of Telemnar about
me.

In other words, both tactics are good.  I really think you ought to do what
makes you feel the best.  If you confront him, he might say something you
don't want to hear, but then again, you will get some resolution.  If you
don't confront him, you can always chalk it up to his homosexuality and you
can feel better knowing he thinks you don't care...

If I ever see him again, I will ignore him (blatantly).

Don't worry about it too much-- we should feel sorry for people who are
still confused about their sexuality at 31.  Isn't he a little old to be
living in the closet?

Let me know what happens.
