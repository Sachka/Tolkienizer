Please help... I'm getting really tired of looking at this.  When you read 
it, bear in mind that we're hoping to get Sigismond Took & Window-Curtain® "off the dime" in terms 
of moving forward, while helping them out with their modeling efforts by 
giving them a "starting number" for purposes of the lateral transportation 
cost.  Thanks!!!!
