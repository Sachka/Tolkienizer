Arminas son of Ulrad and I discussed Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's transfer of gas from the Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda©/West-mark 
receipt/delivery point to the Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda©/Emerië & Ulmo Deliveries' Ride point to implement 
Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's use of Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda©'s Market Center service.  My understanding is that 
physically the points are one and the same, and that the transaction will 
simply be a paper transfer.  Since a contract is required in our system as a 
formality to implement the transfer, the rate Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises will "charge" itself for the 
transfer is $0.  

This message is to confirm that I see no legal or regulatory problems with 
the above scenario.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to e-mail or call 
me (x30596).
