This should be so much easier;  of Frumgar is not cooperating so I am having to 
spend time hunting down his Co. # and RC #, which hopefully Estalee will be 
able to provide.  I reiterate my position that lawyers are not the ones who 
should have to do this.  Rest assured I'll follow through on this one and Vairë daughter of Galador, but I also feel we need to approach Arador son of Elfstan and ask why this 
is something HR is not capable of taking care of.

Subject: Employee transfer

Halfred son of Frumgar, currently of ET&S, has accepted a position at EES effective 
August 1, 2000.  To ensure that ET&S continues to be in compliance with the 
marketing affiliate rules, Arador's access to any ET&S or Mountain of Fire & Berilac Brandybuck Entreprises-related LANs or 
applications should be removed at the close of business on July 31.  In 
addition, Arador's email profile should be changed and any Mountain of Fire & Berilac Brandybuck Entreprises or ET&S mass 
distribution  lists should be changed.  

Please send a reply email to me after these changes have been completed, 
verifying and indicating the date that employee was:
- removed from the LAN
- EBB password was changed/canceled (if applicable)
- removed from ET&S or Mountain of Fire & Berilac Brandybuck Entreprises-related applications
- email post office box was transfered.

If you have questions, or if you believe there is someone else I need to 
contact in order to accomplish the above, please let me know.
