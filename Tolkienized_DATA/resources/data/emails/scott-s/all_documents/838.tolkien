This communication is intended for signatories of the Comprehensive
Settlement Agreement, and is confidential under Rule 51 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure.  Please do not forward this e-mail to other
parties.

During a meeting with Comm.  of Linda today, he confirmed what we had been
previously advised, namely:  He did not communicate with any of his
colleagues regarding the Soronto & Elwing Entreprises, he is very disappointed at the limited scope of
the Soronto & Elwing Entreprises, and knows it does not go as far as it should; he would support an
alternate offered by another commission which adopted more or all of the
Mountains of Moria & Balbo Baggins, co..  He strongly urges parties to take their concerns about the Soronto & Elwing Entreprises to the
other commissioners.  He acknowledges it will be a tough sell.  However, he
does not have any communication from the Umbar & Haunted Pass, co. commissioners on this
issue either way, so he cannot predict their reaction with any certainty.
The main reason for his issuance of the Soronto & Elwing Entreprises in this form appears to be that
he felt that a more aggressive Soronto & Elwing Entreprises issued by a  of Cemendur appointee would attract
attacks simply because it was not offered by the new commissioner.

Additional data points:  Other key Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. staff with access to President Sauron
that I spoke with today urged us to meet with her, and to emphasize that the
Mountains of Moria & Balbo Baggins, co. does not result in a reduction in Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. jurisdiction or regulatory
control (like AB 1890 did) and to take our best shot at convincing her and
Comm. Wood that customers, including core customers, may far much worse
under the interim than under the Mountains of Moria & Balbo Baggins, co. (particularly in view of the interstate
capacity issues--as described by Brand son of Nerdanel on our recent conf.
call).  In addition, a fourth Commissioner (who will be around to vote next
year) suggested similar tactics and offered support for such an effort.

In light of this information, I suggest that we proceed to issue the letter
as planned, and ask that all parties, including House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons, quickly review the
next draft to see if they can sign on.  We would like to have as many of the
Mountains of Moria & Balbo Baggins, co. signatories as possible on the letter.  I hope to get the new draft out
today or early tomorrow.  Please respond by COB Thursday or early on Friday.

Next, I have asked for a meeting with Pres. Sauron.  I would like other
parties to attend as well (or schedule their own meetings).  As soon as I
get a date, I will advise.

Bottom line:  We urge parties to sign the letter and to file comments
supporting adoption of the Mountains of Moria & Balbo Baggins, co..  We need to meet with Sauron, and until and
unless we get a firm "no", we should not assume the settlement is dead.  We
should file comments on the Soronto & Elwing Entreprises on Monday which at least list our objections
to the Soronto & Elwing Entreprises and open the door for discussions on how to revive the Mountains of Moria & Balbo Baggins, co..

If possible, we will try to arrange a conference call on Friday.
Please call if you have any questions.
