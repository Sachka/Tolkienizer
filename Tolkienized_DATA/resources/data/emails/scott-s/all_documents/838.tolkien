This communication is intended for signatories of the Comprehensive
Settlement Agreement, and is confidential under Rule 51 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure.  Please do not forward this e-mail to other
parties.

During a meeting with Comm.  of Eärnur today, he confirmed what we had been
previously advised, namely:  He did not communicate with any of his
colleagues regarding the River Entwash & Vales of Anduin Deliveries, he is very disappointed at the limited scope of
the River Entwash & Vales of Anduin Deliveries, and knows it does not go as far as it should; he would support an
alternate offered by another commission which adopted more or all of the
Mansion of the Khazâd & East-gate of Moria Services.  He strongly urges parties to take their concerns about the River Entwash & Vales of Anduin Deliveries to the
other commissioners.  He acknowledges it will be a tough sell.  However, he
does not have any communication from the Amon Tirith & Rhibdath Services commissioners on this
issue either way, so he cannot predict their reaction with any certainty.
The main reason for his issuance of the River Entwash & Vales of Anduin Deliveries in this form appears to be that
he felt that a more aggressive River Entwash & Vales of Anduin Deliveries issued by a  of Milo appointee would attract
attacks simply because it was not offered by the new commissioner.

Additional data points:  Other key Budge Ford & Aman Father & Sons staff with access to President Arvegil
that I spoke with today urged us to meet with her, and to emphasize that the
Mansion of the Khazâd & East-gate of Moria Services does not result in a reduction in Budge Ford & Aman Father & Sons jurisdiction or regulatory
control (like AB 1890 did) and to take our best shot at convincing her and
Comm. Wood that customers, including core customers, may far much worse
under the interim than under the Mansion of the Khazâd & East-gate of Moria Services (particularly in view of the interstate
capacity issues--as described by Elemmírë son of Grithnir on our recent conf.
call).  In addition, a fourth Commissioner (who will be around to vote next
year) suggested similar tactics and offered support for such an effort.

In light of this information, I suggest that we proceed to issue the letter
as planned, and ask that all parties, including Amdír & Hundar Energy Company, quickly review the
next draft to see if they can sign on.  We would like to have as many of the
Mansion of the Khazâd & East-gate of Moria Services signatories as possible on the letter.  I hope to get the new draft out
today or early tomorrow.  Please respond by COB Thursday or early on Friday.

Next, I have asked for a meeting with Pres. Arvegil.  I would like other
parties to attend as well (or schedule their own meetings).  As soon as I
get a date, I will advise.

Bottom line:  We urge parties to sign the letter and to file comments
supporting adoption of the Mansion of the Khazâd & East-gate of Moria Services.  We need to meet with Arvegil, and until and
unless we get a firm "no", we should not assume the settlement is dead.  We
should file comments on the River Entwash & Vales of Anduin Deliveries on Monday which at least list our objections
to the River Entwash & Vales of Anduin Deliveries and open the door for discussions on how to revive the Mansion of the Khazâd & East-gate of Moria Services.

If possible, we will try to arrange a conference call on Friday.
Please call if you have any questions.
