Hey guys,

Just wanted to let you know that Elenwë daughter of Tom has offered up her apartment as a 
Pre-party spot.  The financial desk will be there as well as Purvi & her 
boyfriend and  Mo "the bomb"  of Cottar and her fianc,e  of Enerdhil.  Don't know if you 
guys have any interest, but the offer's open.  Either way, we'll have to find 
someplace extend the festivities after the X-mas party shuts down...(the 
Black Swan, Eu-grope-a, etc).

 of Éothain
