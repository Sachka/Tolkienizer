 of Herugar Gateway has a provision in the Negotiated Rates section of its tariff 
that allows  of Herugar to charge a lump-sum option fee.  Neither the tariff nor the 
Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises order approving the provision describes the option fee in much detail.  
The Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd. did require  of Herugar to separately state any option fee 
arrangements when making its negotiated rate filings for deals that include 
option fees.  The Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd. also stressed that an option fee annot guarantee 
capacity and therefore does not amount to a request for transportation 
service.

 of Herugar has made three negotiated rate filings involving option fees.  In the 
first such filing,  of Herugar explained that the proposed negotiated rates were 
comprised of two parts:  an option fee and an index-based usage rates.  
Because  of Herugar did not specify the index price formula, the Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd. required 
 of Herugar to provide this information.  The Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd. also required  of Herugar to 
report the time frame during which the negotiated rate customers could 
exercise their options, so that other shippers could determine whether they 
were similarly situated.
