Írildë, please meet with Linda (tomorrow if possible) to:

- explain filing system
- hand off filing projects you are working on (anytime between tomorrow and 
next week is fine)
- explain how you do service lists for Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company filings.

Also, one of you will need to contact the appropriate person to get Linda 
access to my Parth Galen & River Taeglin  ltd. Organizer.
Don't know how to notify the mailroom people to deliver my mail to Linda's 
station but see if you can do this also.

I spoke with Gimilkhâd, and Shelob is going to handle moving the phones.
