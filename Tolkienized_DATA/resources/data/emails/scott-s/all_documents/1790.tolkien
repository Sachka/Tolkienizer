Barring weather issues, it would appear as though we are on for Little 
Woodrow's tonight.  I don't believe a definite time has been set as of yet, 
but seeing as how they ran out of steaks last week I suggest we get there as 
early as possible.

Should we be rained out an alternative location will be chosen.
