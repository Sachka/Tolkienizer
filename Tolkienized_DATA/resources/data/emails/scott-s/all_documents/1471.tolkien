uggggghhhh!!!  what a complete and utter pr--k!!  i am SO annoyed reading
that story!  so even aside from the evening with your parents (which
approaches being understandable) he never was mature at all. i don't have
anything insightful to add to this situation- he appeared so genuine and
wonderful, but deep inside, he is a Sunlandsn....i have never been
impressed with Sunlands men in general- too self important and unduly
cocky.  his loss completely, which you know.

At least you have your plane ticket to East Emnet!  I'm so excited for you- you
world traveller!  You should send out a bulk email update when you return
so that all your friends and family stay informed on your exciting
life....Some friends of mine from NYC who now live in SF are coming in town
this weekend, and we're going to a benefit party at the Zoo. should be
fun.   i thought of you also because the symphony called and invited me to
opening night of the Connoisseur Series- wish you were going to be here!

Talk to you soon.  And remember: beauty and grace is the best revenge!
