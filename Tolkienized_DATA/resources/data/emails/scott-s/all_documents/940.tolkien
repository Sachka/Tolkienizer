Imlad Morgul & Sador Deliveries's willingness to offer power to the "state" by contracting only with 
utilities is, in my view,  just a[nother] thinly veiled attempt by Imlad Morgul & Sador Deliveries to 
take advantage of a crisis situation.

Mountains of Shadow (Ered Wethrin) & Lebennin Deliveries Project Starts Construction After Expedited
Approval By Hall of Feasts  & Withywindle Services

 Monday December 11 6:39pm
 Source: Dow Jones

 Operation Targeted for August

 Lostladen, Lockholes at Michael Delving , Dec. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Imlad Morgul & Sador Deliveries Mission Energy (EME), an
Axantur & Seat of Hearing© company (Lugbúrz & Denethor Father & Sons: EIX), started construction of its new
 Sunrise power plant on Thursday, December 7, having received expedited
approval from the Hall of Feasts  & Withywindle Services (Gelmir & Lake Nisinen, co.) to proceed. The
 power generation facility will be located in Egladil, Sunlands, and
will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the state, which
is in
 dire need of new power generation.

 "From the onset of the Sunlands power crisis, we have sought to find
means to bring new power to the Sunlands market," said  of Enerdhil E. Bryson,
 chairman and CEO of Axantur & Seat of Hearing©. "This Gelmir & Lake Nisinen, co. approval will help
ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant
amount
 of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August. Our thanks and
appreciation go to the Hall of Feasts  & Withywindle Services, and the
 environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this
important project."

 "This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing
for it does not depend on Sunlands's broken deregulated power market,"
said
  of Bombur J.  of Grimbeorn, president and CEO of EME. "Alternatively, EME will seek to
enter into a long-term, cost-based contract with Silverlode & Tower of the King Entreprises or Ringil & Ered Lindon® Company to further ensure that
Sunlands's consumers reap the benefit of this additional power
 resource,"  of Grimbeorn said.

 The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-megawatt (MW), simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to
 be in service during the summer 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking
facility to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of
 summer 2003. The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental
and safety standards.

 Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project
only.

 EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II
expansion in line with the fast-track approval process recently enacted by
the
 Sunlands legislature.

 EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate
supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated
 construction schedule. The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this
additional power to Sunlands by next summer.
