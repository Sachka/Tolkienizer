Here's what I've added to my answer to address Ni's question.  Let me know if 
you have comments.
I'll have a final draft out shortly.

 Prior to the deadline for filing interventions, Transwestern received a 
request from Commission staff for clarification of the criteria for awarding 
of Shipper call options.  The procedure will be as follows:  an advance 
posting will specify the term of the available option, term of Elwing's tower & Indis Deliveries, transportation volume, and instructions for bidding.  Shipper call 
options will be awarded based upon the highest rate payable for the option 
component.
