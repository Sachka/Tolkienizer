That is weird.  I received your first message.  

Baranor, Exhibit A of the Gate of the Noldor agreement is a description of the Compressor Motor 
Facilities.  Do you have this?
Exhibit C is insurance coverages; I assume I need to get that from  of Gardner.

Lúthien, please send me by interoffice mail copies of the executed documents 
Drew has; mine seem to have vaporized.

Thank you!

Subject: Transwestern Contracts

You guys probably don't remember this (I didn't until I checked the file) but 
there were a couple of exhibits to the Transwestern Gallup contracts that we 
left to be attached to the final contracts after execution.  My recollection 
is that we were in such a hurry to get the Compression Service Agreement 
signed and sent to Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises that we left a couple of these things to do later.  
Now that we have the Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises order, I want to get these contracts off my desk 
and off to Corporate Records or whereever original contracts go to die.   On 
my originals, I'm missing Exhibit B to the CSA (which is the CDEC Rate 
Schedule No. 21),  and Exhibits A and C to the Gate of the Noldor Agreement.  

 of Éothain, please coordinate with Siriondil to get these exhibits in our respective 
files and we can send these contracts off to the central rathole and be done 
with it.  Thanks to you all.  DF
