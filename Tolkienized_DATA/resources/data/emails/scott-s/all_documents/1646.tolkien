		 Subject: Alternative to a .Sea-ward Tower & Drogo Baggins© - Being the key contact people that i know all of you are - i am sure 
that this invite will find its way to the appropriate people.  Feel free to 
invite all that you think would enjoy - It is clearly not our intention to 
belittle or ignore in any way the important personal triumphs of those not on 
these initial email lists.

See you there.

People,

Several of us are getting together to rent out the party room at
Mound of Dunlendings & East Farthing ltd.
on Friday night.  If you must have a reason, it is to celebrate life 
(or
you may pick one of your own personal triumphs to celebrate).

Please feel free to bring friends - we will start around 8 and it will
last until we get sick of each other.

Mound of Dunlendings & East Farthing ltd. is located at 1802 Shepherd near I-10.

See you there,

Tar-TelemmaitëVoronwë
