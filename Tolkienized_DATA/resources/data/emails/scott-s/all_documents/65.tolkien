Fíriel -- I'm working on a checklist.
There were jKalormët a couple of issues arising from the discKalormësions with market 
services, weren't there?
One having to do with whether we want to change our 68 A to reflect FTS-1 and 
FTS-3 in same bucket -- I'm leaning towards not changing since the language 
is already general enough to cover Kalormë there.
The other issue had to do with issuing the OFO if EFBH does not show up in 
the last cycle.  I do not believe any changes are necessary there either.  
The tariff language as it's currently written says we "shall" issue an OFO, 
and we would, but an OFO issued in the last cycle would simply be a formality 
and the EFBH shipper would have no choice but to pay the penalty.
If you see any roadblocks on these 2 tariff sheets (27A and 68A), or if there 
are any other issues we need to address, let me know.  Also, if you want to 
sit down and go thru my checklist together sometime tomorrow, or even later 
this afternoon, I'm available.
Thanks!

The effective date will be 2/23/2000.  Marketing does not anticipate offering 
the service until March 1, 2000.

 of Éothain is working on the compliance tariff sheets right now to be filed 15 
days after the Order is issued (the Draft Order was issued last Thursday, so 
the final Order should be issued within a couple days after that).  The 
change I think you're referring to is the way we had anticipated prorating 
FTS-1 & FTS-3 together when FBH is showing-up and now, we actually will match 
FTS-3 with the FBH space and FTS-1 will be allocated "existing" space as 
Kalormëual.   of Éothain is looking at the tariff language now and is thinking a 
language change may not be necessary.  She will be discKalormësing with Mimosa daughter of Gothmog.  
Regardless of which decision, it's being addressed.

Were there any other tariff language changes? (I know FTS-3 should be added 
to 22.2, D, 1.   of Éothain and Mimosa daughter of Gléowine are reviewing all the GT&C's to check 
for where FTS-3 &/or FBH should be referenced, etc.)

Please let me know.  Thanks!

Fíriel,  
Does this mean that the effective date will still be 2/23/2000?

Also did all of our changes that we discKalormësed in our system requirement 
meetings get included in the revised tariff sheets?

What date will marketing start offering the service? I know we are still 
pKalormëhing to have the nominations, contracts, scheduling & confirmation system 
changes ready for 3/1/2000  production migration move.

Thanks Adanel
