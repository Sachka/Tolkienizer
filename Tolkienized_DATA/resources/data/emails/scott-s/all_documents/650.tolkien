Linda -- can you order this for me?
Let me know if you need any info.
I'll need the laptop plus 2 docking stations, one upstairs and one down.
And a normal monitor & keyboard.

 of Haldan,

I've spoke to our purchasing person, Narog & River Carnen© O'gorman, about an order status in 
Amon Rûdh.  According to Narog & River Carnen©, all purchasing from Amon Rûdh and Halls of Waiting goes 
through her.  Therefore, if you need to order a new laptop, Narog & River Carnen© can handle 
all of the arrangements for you.

Thanks,
Celeborn son of Tar-Ciryatan
