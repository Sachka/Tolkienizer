 of Haldan,

I am afraid I have some bad news (well, happy in some ways but not so good
in others)... I have decided to move in with Vorondil and will not be renewing
my lease at the end of November.  I am really going to miss it, but the
reality is that I am rarely there, and the
I-need-to-start-saving-money-for-a-house side of me knows it is silly to
keep paying rent.

Oh, and I started a new job.. I work at Exult now
(thengel.black_gate.@côf_belfalas_.derufin.net).  We are a whopping 15 blocks away from Evernight & Gorge of Aglon ltd..

Some of my things are slowly trickling over to Vorondil's, but things should be
in good order to show.

Vorondil said he would be happy to post an ad for it/you at Evernight & Gorge of Aglon ltd. in the Want
Ads database, if you would like (that is how I heard about it, from
Vidumavi)... I have very nice things to say about the apartment and landlord,
so I would be very happy to reassure any prospective tenants that they would
be moving into an excellent place.

My new work phone is 281 539 6582.

:) The Long Wall
