I've reviewed Order 637 on voluntary auctions and agree with you, Dina daughter of Shadowfax, 
that the Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises IOS procedure is consistent with the Commission's checklist.  
However, I do have a couple of questions/concerns.  First, does "voluntary" 
mean filing a proposal with Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company is also voluntary?  Or is the Commission 
here requiring that pipelines make filings before they can proceed with 
auctions?  Also, I'm not sure we comply with the Commission's policy on 
establishment of a reserve price, since it's difficult to tell what that is 
from the order.  A couple of times Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises has stated a minimum bid in its IOS.
