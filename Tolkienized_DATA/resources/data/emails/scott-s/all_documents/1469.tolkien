It's kind of funny, everybody has the same feeling about the "Ted situation" 
- utter disappointment.  But yes, it is definitely his loss.  And, I loved 
the fact that Bowman (his friend) spent so much time talking to my Dad because 
that had to make Ted feel like a complete jerk (which he is).

I'm am very excited about my trip to East Emnet.  The other guy I mentioned in 
the email, Beregar, is going to be working over there for a few months so I'll 
get to see him there as well.  Plus, in November I'm going to visit my 
brother and his wife in Minas Tirith of Gondor  which should be interesting.  The globe 
trotting continues.

Your weekend sounds like it's going to be pretty fun.  I wish I could be 
there as well, but it is football season so I will be in Emyn Eglain this 
weekend.  I've signed up for all these internet airfare specials though, so 
if some great fares come up for Halls of Waiting to Causeway, in Gondor I can take advantage of 
them.  Talk to you soon.

that's why I never pressed about the past relationships thing (you know, 
afraid of what I might find out).
