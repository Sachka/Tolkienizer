 of Marcho,

Thanks for offering up your extra tickets to the game this weekend.  As it 
turns out, I don't think I'll be needing them - My sister has extra tickets 
next to she and my brother-in-law.  Hope you have a great time and maybe I'll 
see you at the game (although given the crowd I'm not going to count on it).

- - Looks like Saturday's going to be a balmy 90...better bring a sweater.
