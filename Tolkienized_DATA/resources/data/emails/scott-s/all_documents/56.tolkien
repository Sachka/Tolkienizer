Eldalótë and I seem to have gotten  of Bregolas interested in a right to 
terminate if Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's minimum tariff rate ever exceeds the contract rate.  They 
said they would mull it over, at least.

But what they really would prefer to have is a provision in which they would 
get the contract rate no matter what.  Since this would make it a negotiated 
rate deal from day 1, I feel like I need to get your buy-in before we agree 
to it.  Amroth has already told me it is OK with him.  Please advise.
