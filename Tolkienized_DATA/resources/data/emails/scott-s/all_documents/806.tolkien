Drogo son of Hiril,

I am a first year law student at Elendë & West©, and currently seeking a summer
associate position with a well-regarded Halls of Waiting law firm.

I have attached my resume and would very much like to meet with you while I
am home in Halls of Waiting during winter break in order to discuss a possible
clerkship with your firm.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.


Warmest regards,
Éowyn daughter of Amras
