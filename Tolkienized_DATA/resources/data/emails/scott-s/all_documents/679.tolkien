Hi, Sooz!  Hope you made it home without too many weather problems.  Was
concerned when we saw the tornado warnings.  We enjoyed meeting  of Hob and
really appreciate your taking the time to drive here to meet Siriondil.

Have a good week.  Looking forward to seeing you again for Thanksgiving!
love, mum
