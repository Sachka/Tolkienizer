Hey Malantur,

It's funny you mentioned  of Cemendur because I just got an email from him this 
morning.  He seems to think he'll be in Halls of Waiting in the near future as well.  
Hopefully, we can all get together and go out or hit steak night for some 
cold ones.  So H-town for six weeks Gimilkhâd?  Why the mixed feelings?  Are they 
work related or were you just starting to get settled in East Emnet?  Anyway, 
I'll have to give Aranarth a call about the big news...I may have an idea what 
it's all about but then again maybe not.  So what's with this Kiwi girl?  
Because, I actually have made some progress regarding East Emnet.  Turns out 
there may be some structuring and originating opportunities for me over there 
which would be much more in line with where I'd like my "career" to be going 
versus the other opportunities I was being offered.  Either way, I won't be 
going over until March or April of next year so it's still a ways off.

As for the guy scene...yes, there has been some courting but nothing really 
to speak of.  I've gone out on a couple of dates but I can't say I really see 
them going anywhere.  Most of the guys around my age are still pretty 
insecure and I'm never going to be the kind of girl that wants to "shape and 
mold them" into men...I just don't have the patience or the inclination.  And 
the other end of the spectrum (single guys in their late 30's/early 40's) who 
seem to hover around like gnats just give me the creeps.  Oh well, as I've 
said before "hope springs eternal".

Talk to you soon,
 of Haldan

Sue,
How are you?  What's new in H-town?  Any new guys on the scene--doing
their 'courting'?  I will be coming back to Halls of Waiting for 6 weeks in a week!
Actually kind of excited--mixed feelings though.  So, Aranarth has some big 
news that I think would only be right for you to hear from him.  An aside,
if you come to East Emnet, I know a fun Kiwi girl that wants to move closer to
work--just looking out for you  of Haldan.  Made any progress on getting over
here?  

Hopre you are well.  I'll call you when I get into town.
