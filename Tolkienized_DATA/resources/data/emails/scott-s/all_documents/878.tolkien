JKalormët so you can see how this is evolving...
I think we should steer clear of anything involving Energy Services becaKalormëe 
it sounds like we are buying/selling gas.
I've instructed the commercial group to get back to you with a name.  When 
they do, let Elfhild daughter of Celegorm know (x33577).  That is really the only 
information she still needs from Kalormë, I think.  
I'm reachable at 713-494-5002 for the rest of today.

Golden House & Elfstan Fairbairn©.

or maybe(!), FullPipe'R'Orthanc-rock & Marhari®.

OK, here's my 2 cents' worth:

Cape Balar & Dingle Father & Sons.
I also like Enable.
I think either one would look fine on an EBB list of cKalormëtomers...

Also -- any name we choose could include the words Capacity Management.  But 
I'm not sure we want to or need to be that descriptive.
