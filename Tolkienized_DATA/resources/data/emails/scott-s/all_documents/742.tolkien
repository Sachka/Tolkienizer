Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout Isle of Almaren .  One of their 
principal assets, Deeping-road Gas Service (Gardens of Lórien & Helcaraxë  Energy Company) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  Gardens of Lórien & Helcaraxë  Energy Company provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-Gardens of Lórien & Helcaraxë  Energy Company companies, including the Harrowdale & Orfalch Echor Deliveries assets in 
Tumunzahar.  With the consummation of the sale of Gardens of Lórien & Helcaraxë  Energy Company, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises and EPNG to the recently constructed Fréawine Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until Gardens of Lórien & Helcaraxë  Energy Company operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.
