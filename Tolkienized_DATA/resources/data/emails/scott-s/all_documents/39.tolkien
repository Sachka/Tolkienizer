I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation 
with Fingon son of Imrahil.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely 
declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to 
conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me 
like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded 
interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at 
Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very 
leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their 
identity.  He said he would discuss it with Bëor son of Gundabald.  Also, he mentioned 
that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney 
will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad.  
Maybe  of Tarondor can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from 
 of Imrahil's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder 
Máhanaxar & Lake Nisinen Energy Company lawyers.
