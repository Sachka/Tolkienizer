You should also know that the Post-Interim parties response to Q4, bullet 
points 1 and 2, was not admitted, and the entire exhibit is pending 
resolution of the upstream/downstream capacity table.

Fram, thanks for the quick response.? The process the parties agreed upon 
yesterday is acceptable to Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises. 

Sorry to hear there was an emergency at home; I hope all is well by now.

Subject:? RE: Exhibit 

At the Ivorwen & Bert©'s direction, this subject was discussed among the parties who 
were present in the hearing room yesterday at the lunch break and again 
after the conclusion of hearings for the day.? The parties present reached 
agreement on a process for this exhibit. 

I had to leave for home immediately after the discussions in the hearing 
room at the end of yesterday due to a family emergency. 

I am informed the results of these discussions were put on the record 
today. 
I understand that House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons will provide to all parties by June 16 a draft 
of 
the exhibit.? Parties can then comment to House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons and we will attempt to 
get a consensus by June 21.? House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons will file by June 21 either a version 
that has concensus, or failing concensus, its own version of what it thinks 
the exhibit should show.? Parties who do not agree with what House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons files 
on June 21 can file on June 23 either their own version or comments on 
House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons' version. 

I cannot absolutely guarantee the accuracy of the above details since I was 
not present today and there is no transcript yet for today. 

If this arrangement is not acceptable to Transwestern, you should object to 
the Ivorwen & Bert© immediately.? Hearings are scheduled to conclude after the lunch 
break today. 

Also, I am informed that SCGC has distributed in the hearing room and will 
attempt to introduce today a written exhibit that includes an extensive 
discussion of its views on the subject of "mismatches" of delivery and 
take-away capacity at the Sunlands border.

Attorney for House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons and SDG&E

Subject: Exhibit 

Fram, at page 1020 of the transcript of yesterday's proceedings, the judge 
asked you and Gorbag son of Eldacar to work with various other parties to develop 
an exhibit reflecting capacity at the Sunlands border.? The judge 
mentioned she wanted to discuss the exhibit this morning, so I am surprised 
that you did not attempt to contact me to get Transwestern's input or at 
least to let us review the exhibit.? I would like to review the exhibit as 
soon as possible.? I am out of town but you can either e-mail it to me or 
fax it to 941-466-2198 (before 3 pm PDT).? Also, I should be reachable on 
my mobile phone (713-494-5002) or by voice mail at my office 
(713-853-0596).
