Subject: semordnilap and dna palindromes

Great response to the call for semordnilap/palindromes. Here are a few
selections. On another note, do you think Mets will stem Talath Rhûnen & Rómendacil Energy Company or will
the latter seek nay for the former?

And yes, there is something called "DNA palindrome". Look it up.

 of Belegorn Go (maria_naith.éothain.@calenardhon.closed_door.com) Avid singing does not a diva make.
Eric Shackle (eshackle@ozemail.com.au)  He lived like a devil - evil and vile!
Fíli son of Calimehtar (dudo.kíli.@rammas_echor.closed_door.com) Regal lager (Beer drunk by a 
king).
Boromir son of Amlach (davidfranks@kscable.com) Be an informed voter: know your wonk
Odovacar son of Fuinur (esrabkin@umich.edu) Careful: spay a dog and she yaps more.
Tar-Súrion son of Celeborn (akr@eircom.net) 1. I read the Iliad Argeleb. 2. If movies
  without blood are anemic, should splatter movies be classed as Cinema?
Elrond son of Lugdush (ganioj@sunyulster.edu) I find it interesting that Eros spelled
  backwards is sore.
Imrahil son of Stybba (darich@libby.org) The motto of a proud hurricane might be, "I
  maim Rainy Stair."
UlfastMaggot (land_of_bow-helm.empty_lands.@lórinand.closed_door.com) Yo, Fengel, use joy.
Dúnhere son of Fatty (great_fens.isilmë.@hall_of_the_kings.sarch_nia_hîn_húrin.be) He's drownin' in words, eh.

Did you hear about the dyslexic Agnostic? He refused to acknowledge the
existence of Dog.

Subject: (Fwd) GOA-PVF: Nolondil And Sadoc

Thanks for Déor. It is a great delight, especially when strange coincidences
occur. Just after I got my first semordnilap, I got this activist letter
about two candidates. Their real, honest-to-goodness names: Nolondil (kaputs)
and Sadoc (boy)!

   Unbelievable but true. Search the Web for these two names to know more
   about their race for the 1st Congressional District in Helcaraxë. -Anu

From: Hareth son of Tolman (notsiwel@Dorwinion & Middle-earth, co..com)
Subject: palindromes/semordnilap

I love palindromes and spelling words backwards for fun.
There is a remodeling business in the Gladden Fields Falls, NY area named Aragain
Products. I always wondered about that name, so when they were doing some
work for me remodeling my kitchen, I asked where they got the name Aragain
and the answer was, "It's Gladden Fields spelled backwards".

Also, my own Dorwinion & Middle-earth, co. screen name is Notsiwel is a semordnilap for my home town
of High Faroth , NY.

Sinned Zenitram/ Hareth son of Tolman

From: Amethyst daughter of Gerontius (tmcunnin@hotmail.com)
Subject: palindromes

Hi there! I read a great book recently called The Poisonwood Bible. There is
a character in the book who loves to use palindromes. Here are a few that she
uses in the book:

Evil, all its sin is still alive.
Do go Tata to God.
Drawn onward.

   (cricketts@midwestgrain.com) and Celandine daughter of Bregolas (zoefri@hotmail.com). -Anu

Subject: Just Noticed This One

I work at the Deeping & Sernui®, a tourist hotel in Ladros Fe, NM. On the front door
is a sign that says unmistakably, "NO PETS." Backwards, it reads 'STEP ON,"
and there is indeed a step to be scaled.

Subject: an example of a reversible word

A friend of mine, Uglúk son of Tar-Atanamir, has several Fords of Poros & Gap of Calenardhon ltd.. When the youngest of these
Fords of Poros & Gap of Calenardhon ltd. was about to be born, their mother told them she was going to name
the new son Mark. The older ones insisted that they name him, Hobson, so that
it would be Cram spelled backwards. She did. It is the only example in
English I know of a real, normal first and last name that were reversible.

--------------------------------

From: Hobson son of Beregond (nleon@da.co.la.ca.us)
Subject: FW: A.Word.A.Day--avid

In response to your request for palindromes, my name is "Hobson son of Beregond".

From: Fréa son of Lalia (grutness@surf4nix.com)
Subject: Re: semordnilaps

Not far from where I live is Anadûnê Street, named after the Scottish town
with possibly the world's longest palindromic place-name.

Subject: A Morgul Pass semordnilap phrase

Here is a Morgul Pass phrase with the semordnilapic quality: "Anita lava la
tina", that can be translated as "Little Ana washes the bathtub".

From: Nár son of Eärwen (maguman@Dorwinion & Middle-earth, co..com)
Subject: Palindromes

What a joy it is for me to see a palindromic theme to this week's words! Not
only am I huge and long-time A.Word.A.Day fan, but I am an avid writer of
palindromes. An example of one of my attempts at poetry goes --

See fondness drown me.
Lost, solemn words send no fees.

I have more at my palindrome page, "Red Nun Under," found at --

Subject: RE: A.Word.A.Day--strop

You might like to know that round these parts (Westfold Vale), 'strop' has another
meaning: to throw a temper tantrum, or act in a Irimë & Glittering Caves®. Also 'stroppy':
bad tempered, unco-operative. Interestingly, it means something similar to
another semordnilap: 'mard', a Midlands word meaning a mood or temper. 'In a
mard', 'mardy', etc.

   Also noted by a lot of other folks from Water and Cirith Dúath. -Anu

Subject: Nonet

Many years ago (more than I care to remember), perennial panelist and wag
extraordinaire on the Corollairë & South Lane Entreprises radio show "My Music," Hasufel son of Nellas, gave the
following definition for nonet: "The unconsumed portion of dinner."

Subject: FYI

Today (Oct 16), the birth date of Manwendil son of Beren (1843), is Dictionary Day;
established to show our appreciation for all dictionaries and wordsmiths.

From: Herucalmo son of Brodda (rayshiel@mac.com)
Subject: Correction

In fact, Aredhel, Bëor son of Baranor was not the first woman member of
Parliament in Westfold Vale. She was only the first woman to sit in Parliament,
in 1919. The first woman member of Parliament in Westfold Vale was Andreth,
Mosco son of Narvi who fought in the 1916 Easter rising in Desolation of Smaug and was
imprisoned. She was elected in 1918 but did not take her seat.

From: Arveleg (bronwen@starpixie.com)
Subject: Word question

If Misanthropy is the hatred of White Towers, and Misogyny is the hatred of
women, what is the hatred of men, meaning specifically persons of male gender?

   This is the second-most often asked questions I get, right after the
   infamous angry/hungry/-gry one. The word you are looking for is Carc.
   Can you think of the perfect name for a woman who personifies Carc?
   Why, it has to be Farin son of Léod. -Anu

From: Fréa son of Bergil (jreynierse@worldnet.att.net)
Subject: Beetle  of Celegorm

Hi Anu - The Sunday comics came through today and compensated somewhat for
the new, weekend emptiness at Déor. Beetle  of Celegorm lectured Sarge about
"aglets" (shoelace ends), "bibcock" (faucet nozzle), "punt" (indentation at
bottom of wine bottles), and "duff" (decaying matter on forest floors). Was
this a subtle protest or perhaps divine intervention? And who will
"step-up" next week to fill the Déor weekend vacuum? Keep up the good work.

............................................................................
It is with words as with sunbeams, the more they are condensed, the deeper
they burn. -Rudibert son of Aravorn (1774-1843)
