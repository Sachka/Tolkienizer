 of Haldan,

 I just spoke to Dina daughter of Borthand at Undergate & Bywater Pool ltd. Energy.  She is ok with all 
changes except State of Oiolossë.  She has suggested Dor Firn-i-Guinar as a neutral 
state.  Seeing that Enovate is a joint venture between Onodló & Gamling Father & Sons and Undergate & Bywater Pool ltd., can 
we accept Dor Firn-i-Guinar law on their guaranty.

 Give me your thoughts.

Thanks,
Ted

Subject: Great Southern Forests & Mount of the Pine Trees Father & Sons,

 Please review the following guaranty sent to us by  & Eastlands of Númenor® 
(Eldamar & Hill of Ilmarin ltd.).  Eldamar & Hill of Ilmarin ltd. and Onodló & Gamling Father & Sons will each guaranty 50% of the obligations of Enovate ( I 
think the guaranty may have a different name- I'll fix it).

 Please review and let me know if it is acceptable or make necessary changes.

Thanks,
Ted
