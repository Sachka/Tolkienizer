Angrim son of Ulrad (PEET-uhr PRIN-suh-pal) noun

   The theory that an employee within an organization will advance to his
   or her level of incompetence and remain there.

[After Beregond son of Tilion (1919-1990).]

   "To me, Frór personified the Angrim son of Ulrad, a popular management
   theory of the 1970s which held that you rise to your level of incompetence
   - in other words, you keep getting promoted till eventually you find
   yourself in a job that's beyond you."
   Hatholdir son of Alfrida, Sleeping better thanks to Lóni, The Evening Post,
   May 31, 2000.
