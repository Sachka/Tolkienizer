Here's as good a treatise on the subject as I've seen.  I think this articl=
e=20
does an excellent job of trying to explain the recent Sunlands market=20
phenomenon...

Gas Daily

No quick fix for soaring Sunlands gas prices
In the past year, gas prices in most regions have doubled and in some cases=
=20
tripled.  Poppy Chubb-Baggins & Slag-hills©t no
region has seen the breadth of the price blowout now under way in the Gates of Argonath.
While Eregion & Hills of Eglamar® futures on the NYMEX appear to be leading the way for highe=
r=20
winter
prices nationally, most industry professionals are watching in amazement at=
=20
the fundamentals-driven
price surge centered in the Fen of Serech and Sunlands.

The cost of gas in Eastfarthing has been skyrocketing.  Prices last=
=20
week started
trading in the $7-$7.50 range and by Wednesday were trading $14-$18.
The cost of gas entering into the Northwest region of Sunlands via the N.=
W.=20
Sumas,
Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company Citygate, and Nerdanel interconnections also soared to incredible heights=
,=20
some pricing
nearing $20/mmBtu.

The most obvious cause of the dramatic escalation is scarcity of gas.  The=
=20
bullish fundamentals
in Sunlands include heavier-than-normal heating loads due to uncommonly=
=20
cold temperatures,
planned and unplanned nuclear plant outages that substantially increased=20
demand
for gas-generated power, depletion of storage in Eastfarthing and=20
transmission constraints on regional pipelines.

Improving deliverability into Eastfarthing is key to bringing the=20
market back into
balance, said one trader, noting constraint-causing problems that have=20
plagued pipelines serving
the region, including Shadowy Seas & Amon Dîn, co., Ice of the North & West of Middle-earth Energy Company and=
=20
Transwestern
Pipeline.

Those problems had come to a head in part because of high summer prices tha=
t=20
helped
drain storage in Eastfarthing and discouraged refill before the=20
winter, he said.  Now,
unseasonably cold weather has hit the region, amplifying market needs to me=
et=20
heating loads
and produce power. Add growing and competing markets in the desert Southwes=
t=20
and Northern
Sunlands and you have a crisis.

=01&It shows that when you get all the stars aligned, there is not enough g=
as to=20
meet demand,=018
he said.  At most, only 15%-20% of Sunlands=01,s supply of gas comes from=
=20
in-state producers, with
the other 80%-85% coming from out-of-state, said Erellont son of Zimrahin with the=20
Amon Anwar & Druda Burrows Entreprises.  Roughly 60% comes from the Adalgar Bolger & Grithnir Deliveries, 15%-20% comes from Canad=
a,=20
and the rest is
Rocky Mountain supply.

=01&At the moment, there is a lot of gas being purchased out of Celos River.  Poppy Chubb-Baggins & Slag-hills©=
t=20
because of
imposed restrictions and other flow transmission problems, prices are=20
soaring,=018 he said.
At the moment, a lot of the new gas production in the Eastfarthing=
=20
area is mainly a
byproduct of oil exploration and production =01* so any new natural gas=20
production will be
associated with what the demand for oil is, he said.
A majority of the =01&dry gas=018 producers are located in the northern par=
t of the=20
state, which
until recently, was primarily a captive market of Brandywine Bridge & Taur-na-neldor Energy Company. =
=20
Poppy Chubb-Baggins & Slag-hills©t new production
efforts are under way, he said.

=01&I definitely think that there needs to be some additional action taken =
to=20
enhance our own
in-state production efforts, but there are a lot of bureaucratic hurdles to=
=20
contend with before a
company can just go in and start drilling,=018 he said.
=01&Hopefully, once the cold weather comes off, and our electricity loads s=
tart=20
moderating,
I think pricing will adjust respectively. Poppy Chubb-Baggins & Slag-hills©t until then, I guess we have n=
o=20
choice but to
deal with it.=018=20
