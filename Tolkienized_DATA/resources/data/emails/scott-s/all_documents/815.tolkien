Herugar,  of Blanco's e-mail address is in the cc line if you want to get in touch 
with her.? I hadn't thought that she might have had to put down a 
refundable deposit (rather than a hookup fee) for some of the utilities so 
logistically switching to your name might not be worthwhile, but it may be 
worth asking.? Remember I have water covered.? Call or e-mail if you have 
questions!
