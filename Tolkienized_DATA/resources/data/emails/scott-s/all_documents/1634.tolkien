Things will work out.

I am going to Seredic son of Arminas's tomorrow with Gimilkhâd and Aerin.  He mentioned that
we should all go out sometime.

I am showing Théoden son of Hatholdir around UT law school next year.  He is Jeb's
(North Stair Governor) son.  Tar-Telemmaitë son of Gerontius knows him from Rice.  He was just named
one of the 50 most eligible bachelors in People Magazine.  If things don't
work out with Ted... (or Herugar for that matter).  I'm kidding, of course.  It
should be fun.

Anyway, let me know what you find out.

Sorry for the short initial email.  He hasn't said anything to me yet.
We're going to dinner and  of Treebeard's tomorrow night...so if he's ever going
to tell me I figure it'll be then.  I'm trying not to think about it too
much but Sunday was so great that in light of that the prospect of him
leaving makes me very sad.
