Hello Arador.
 
My understanding is that Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company does not yet require electronic contracting, 
but that many pipelines do offer it voluntarily.  

Best regards,

Subject: Question


Hi,...did I guess correctly as to your e-mail addresses?  If so, I have a
question....

Do you happen to know if there are Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company rules requiring interstate pipelines
(are you familiar with any?) to offer e-contracting (including e-signature)
to customers/shippers, or is it a discretionary service...... or not a
service at all?

Of course, I need to do my own legal research, but maybe you two know off
the top of your head.

Thanks, and cheers...
