See the attached.  Northfarthing of the Shire & Filibert Bolger Father & Sons has already authorized Tolman Cherry to add 
Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. to the list of parties at the end of the document.  I recommend Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises do 
the same.  I propose that we ask Tolman to add Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises to the list, with a footnote 
that we support the transmission proposal only and do not oppose the other 
parts of the term sheet.  (I propose this out of an abundance of caution 
because in one part of the document Tolman states the parties have agreed on 
comprehensive settlement, but later in the document he states that the 
parties aren't fully committed yet.)  If he will not agree to do this, then I 
would suggest we leave Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises off the list and file a letter with the Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. along 
the lines of what I circulated yesterday, with additional language supporting 
the motion for extension of time.  Let me know what you think.
