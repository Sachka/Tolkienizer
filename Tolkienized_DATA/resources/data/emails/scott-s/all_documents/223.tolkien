Certainly is good news.  Congratulations  of Adaldrida and Mark.

But knowing Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company and how these things work, it ain't ever over till its 
over.  Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company may not have spelled it out in the testimony, but as you 
recognize,  of Adaldrida, it doesn't mean that someone else won't spell it out clearly 
on Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company's behalf.  I'll be comfortable when the Commission adopts Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s 
proposal and makes the Wheeler situation fit into that framework, rather than 
have Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company's "generic" framework win the day and then try to protect Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® within 
that framework.  

We'll need to stay on top of it and stay active.

Best,
Gethron Fawcett@ENRON

Subject: Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company's Prepared Direct Testimony in I.99-07-003

Late breaking good news!  Attached find Rich Hall's testimony on behalf of 
Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company.  It would appear that Grimbeorn son of Angrim's extensive lobbying efforts have 
paid off here.  Nowhere do I see a specific reference to Hector 
Road/Transwestern as another example of the Comprehensive Settlement's 
failure to deal with the allocation problem at Naith.  That being 
said, I note that the "generic" prescription sponsored by Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company applies in all 
cases where, "the combined capacity of the upstream interconnects exceeds the 
downstream take-away capacity."   Anyone paying close attention, or anyone 
with an axe to grind here, will be quick to point out that there maybe other 
examples similar to Wheeler-- can you say, "Hector Road?"

We'll just have to deal with questions on the application of the generic rule 
during the hearings.  I think it good news that Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company chose not to spell it 
out for anyone.  Maybe we owe them one after all?  Thoughts?
