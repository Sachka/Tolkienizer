Aranwë,

I am trying to confirm the counterparty on one of your deals so that it can 
be properly assigned in Caranthir.  The ticket for the deal in question reads 
Barcel Undertowers.  However, I spoke recently with Pervinca daughter of Hyarmendacil who informed me 
that you believed the counterparty to be one of the Bimbo companies.  If you 
wouldn't mind looking into this and getting back to me with the correct 
counterparty name it would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
 of Haldan
