Hey  of Gerontius,

You'll be happy to know that I think I finally caught up on all of the sleep 
I've been missing out on of late.  Last week was extremely trying at work, I 
think I probably put in a good 70-75 hrs. between Monday and Friday, and thus 
resulted in me being a complete and total vegetable this weekend.  Anyway, 
I'm assuming you've been trying to relax as well and have some fun before 
embarking on your new career with Woods of Núath & Prisca Baggins ltd..  I'm sure your decision to leave 
Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. and move back to Falls of Irvin will prove to be the right one.    

In regards to dinner this Friday...I would definitely like to get together 
before you leave.  Given how I've been feeling on Friday evenings as of late 
(monumentally exhausted), sometime earlier in the week might be better.  
However, if Friday's the only time you can do it then Friday it is.  Just let 
me know what works for you.  Of course, regardless of what night it is, it's 
probably going to have to be on the later side to accommodate Elrohir's Thranduil 
(i.e. me).

 of Haldan
