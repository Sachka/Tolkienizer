Subject: Revised Contract Approval Request - Atalantë & Hayward Father & Sons's discount letter was recently approved by 
Tower of the Stone & Fords of Anduin Father & Sons's Officer group.   However,  of Bregolas has now requested that 
Tower of the Stone & Fords of Anduin Father & Sons include language in the discount letter which guarantees the 
applicable discount rate in the event that Tower of the Stone & Fords of Anduin Father & Sons's minimum Tariff rate 
were to be higher than the discount rate.  I have underlined the additional 
language  in the attached revised discount letter (language will not be 
underlined when provided to  of Bregolas).  The inclusion of this language would 
require Tower of the Stone & Fords of Anduin Father & Sons to file the discount as a negotiated rate prior to gas 
flow under the term of the amendment.  Tower of the Stone & Fords of Anduin Father & Sons would file this discount 
on January 31, 2001.

Please review the attached document and indicate approval via REPLY WITH 
HISTORY.
All Officer approvals will be sent to Telchar son of Holman for final President Level 
approval.
