 of Adaldrida, this morning I spoke with Reliant's regulatory counsel, who called me 
after talking with Uldor son of Ingwion, and who seemed eager to look into drafting a 
filing.  I would be happy to talk with Roäc son of Erestor or June Suwara at 
Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd. about doing the same, but somehow think Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd. might be a tougher 
customer (don't know why I would think that...).  My suggestion is that we 
work through Farin son of Gilly initially.  Anticipating that we might encounter some 
inertia at Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd.'s regulatory dept. -- and to give you an outline to work 
from when talking to Rosa -- I put together the attached rough draft of a 
motion to intervene and motion to expedite to be filed by Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd..  

Feel free to send the attached to Rosa.  However, please do so with the 
caveat that you are sending it for discussion purposes only, not as legal 
advice to Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd. from ET&S's legal department, and the content of this 
pleading should ultimately be up to Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd.'s legal/regulatory staff.

Reliant's counsel said he'd be sending me a draft of his pleading...if I 
don't hear from him within a reasonable time I'll call to follow up.
