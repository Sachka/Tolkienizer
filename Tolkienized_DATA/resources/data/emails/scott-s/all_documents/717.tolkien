Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.   of Minardil has asked Gimilkhâd son of Fastred if 
Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cracks of Doom. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cracks of Doom about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. or Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company or even Willowbottom Blue Mountains & Lagduf, co. to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Gimilkhâd son of Minardil's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df
