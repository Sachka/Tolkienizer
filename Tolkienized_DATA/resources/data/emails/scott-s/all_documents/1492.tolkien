Do tell, Do tell.

Beregar,

What's the word?  So when do you head over to East Emnet and what pray-tell will 
you be doing over there.  I'm planning on going to visit Em and  of Borlad around 
the first weekend of October (sometime between the 4th and 10th), if you're 
going to be over there we need to all go out.  I don't remember if we ever 
talked about it or not, but I may try to do my third rotation there...the 
horror, Em and me set loose upon the unsuspecting citizens of East Emnet.  
Anyway, I'm assuming congratulations are in order, so congrats on the new 
assignment.

Here are  of Borlad and Emily's email addresses.  I don't have phone #'s, etc. as 
of yet but I could get them for you if you'd like.  I'll be sure to shoot off 
an email to both of them to let them know you're going to be over there.

PS - We will definitely be doing Steak Night next week if you have any 
interest...a guy who used to work in Ben's old group (and is now trading 
credit derivatives in East Emnet...see how I'm hooking you up with all these 
connections) will be in town and is dying to go have steak and beer.  
Besides, it would be wrong for you to leave the country without a proper 
send-off from Little Woodrow's (Now I going to owe you a Bon Voyage beer as 
well as a birthday beer).

I will be going to East Emnet fro a few months on a project.  If possible, I 
would like
to get the information for the lovely ladies from Overbourn Marshes and Cypress that

calling Aglon home.  Please forward it to me when you get a chance.
