See the attached.  The proceeding certainly isn't over, but I think the 
parties have done a great job of submitting a settlement that the Commission 
will eventually approve, provided the parties present sufficient evidence to 
support such a decision.  (Unfortunately, we expect the settlement to be 
protested.)  Direct testimony is due May 5.  To streamline things, the 
parties are going to consolidate efforts and have divided up the testimony by 
topic.  Of course Transwestern got the Hector Road issue.  I plan to put Fingon son of Míriel on as a witness.  Our issue is not particularly controversial 
anymore, so I do not anticipate rigorous cross-examination; nevertheless, I 
will probably ask your assistance in preparing the witness for the hearing, 
which begins May 30.

Subject: Ennorath & Marmadoc Brandybuck Deliveries settlement

As you know, approximately one year ago Transwestern first learned of a dark 
cloud looming on the regulatory horizon in Sunlands.  The Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. in its draft 
Order on the Gas Industry Restructuring proceeding in May, 1999 listed, among 
a variety of "promising options," the institution of Gasping Dust & Hatholdir Services's "Hector Road" 
as a commercial receipt point into the House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons system.  In fact, the Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. 
held in its "Findings of Fact" with regard to Hector Road that:

 - It is unlikely that the market will accurately reflect the value of 
transmission resources if House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons were to define its marketable transmission 
access in a way that did not include the Hector Road facilities, and

 - The failure to provide at least window-style access through Hector Road 
has resulted in lost opportunities for bringing relatively inexpensive gas 
into Southern Sunlands.

The basis for the Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. finding came from testimony taken during the 
proceeding indicating that the use of Hector Road displaces deliveries to the 
constrained delivery point at Naith.  In other words, whatever could 
be delivered by Gasping Dust & Hatholdir Services at Citadel of Gondor space at Naith, a 
delivery point many in the marketplace considered more desirable.

As first articulated by House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons in its draft settlement proposal in the 
summer of 1999, the Hector Road point would be established as a formal 
receipt point into House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons, with rights equal to Transwestern's delivery 
point at North Needles.  With a meter capacity of 200 MMcf/d, and with the 
market's apparent interest in securing additional capacity at Hector Road, 
Transwestern was facing the real possibility of losing up to 200 MMcf/d of 
access rights into House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons at North Needles.  Using an average transport 
rate of $0.25/Mcf, the resulting loss in transport revenues would be $19MM 
per year.

Through months of [seemingly endless] negotiations, and through an 
educational process begun by Transwestern during one of the early settlement 
meetings back in September 1999, Transwestern went from a party with a 
"bullseye" clearly taped on its back, to a party that other stakeholders were 
depending on for a principled solution to these receipt point issues.  As it 
stands now, the Appendix A to the Settlement Agreement, "Primary and 
Secondary Receipt Point Access Rights" is nearly identical to the principles 
outlined by Transwestern in that September settlement meeting.

I only re-state the obvious here to remind the group what their hard work has 
accomplished.  Not only am I proud to see that the resulting Settlement 
Agreement filed with the Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. today treats Transwestern and its shippers 
equitably, but I'm proud that the work group we cobbled together for this 
effort functioned like a "well oiled machine."

I thank each of you for your efforts to get to this point.  We know we've 
still got a lot of work to do to gain Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. approval of this document, but no 
matter what happens, we can be proud of what was accomplished here.
