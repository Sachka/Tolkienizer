I was wondering if you had fallen off the face of the Troll's Cave...

It is definitely good to hear from you, I was just thinking about you today 
and wondering what you're up to.  Things in Halls of Waiting are pretty good.  I went 
to Causeway, in Gondor over Labor Day weekend to visit a friend of mine there and just 
went to Austin this past weekend for the Mount of the Pine Trees & Taur-en-Faroth Deliveries football game (I know 
you're not a big fan but they are very fun).  As for work, all is well.  I'm 
actually going to meet with the development manager for the analyst program 
to discuss what my options are after this second rotation is up.  Of course 
my goal is to do a rotation in East Emnet for a year and then get promoted to the 
Associate program (so basically I'm going to ask this lady tomorrow what I 
need to do to ensure that outcome).  Honestly, I think my odds are pretty 
good.  

Glad to hear everything with you is going so well, not that I'm surprised.  
Congrats on the new responsibilites they must be keeping you pretty busy up 
there (any trips scheduled to Halls of Waiting in the near future?).

As for my social life...if you would of asked me a week or two ago I would 
have said fantastic, incredible, etc.  Now, I just don't know.  For the life 
of me I am never going to be able to figure out your gender.  But as they 
say, "Hope springs eternal" and I intend to remain an optimist despite many 
road blocks.

Talk to you soon,
Asgon Kriegel@EES

So what is going on...
I have not heard from you in a while and i'm  wondering how my favorite Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries 
"girl" trader is doing, and how the summer has been.
I know a lot has happen, i was hopping that you would bring me up to date 
with what is going on with you and work, and your social life. (Yes guys....)

I'm great....great summer. my best friend from Elostirion spend 2 1/2 month with 
me, (well stayed at my sisters place) and that was a lot of fun.
Work is great, though very strssful and demanding...very nerve recking..but i 
love and i'm making my marks where i can, and when i can. You know me.
I'm now Manager of Internet Marketing and Manager of Alliances...that's my 
new job also...

Moontower & Marroc Brandybuck Services is doing great and you will hear a lot about us in the near 
future...Were live, so that's really cool.

Life is great, Mere of Dead Faces & Nimrodel, co. i'm pleased and i love NY.
Big summer, like a little rock super star...and i've just started working out 
again this past week end, after a 3 month brake.
So just rolling along...
What's new

hope your well.
Best
Caliondo
