Hey  of Marmadoc,

I just got back from East Emnet Tuesday and am now almost fully recovered from 
the jet lag.  I had an absolutely incredible time while I was over there and 
was even able to go into the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. office for a while.  One of the guys I 
knew here in Halls of Waiting even set up an impromptu interview for me while I was 
there so I think my working over there may be a very real possibility.  Since 
I'd already done a lot of the touristy things the last time I was in East Emnet 
Emily and I pretty much just hung out.  We went out to eat Friday night and 
then to a club ( I think we got home around 4 am after indulging in some fish 
and chips).  Saturday and Sunday we mostly just wondered around the city to 
various shops and markets and went out to various lunch and dinner venues.  
Finally, on Monday I went in to the office while Em was at school and then 
had a fairly big last night in town with some friends of Halbarad & Bony ridge Deliveries.  Hope 
everything's been going well with you and that the move into your new place 
was a success.  I'll keep checking for great fares out to SD...I'd love to 
meet your roommate and all of your other friends I feel as though I know now.

 of Haldan

PS - I think you're right about the Sunlands men.  I am currently in 
contact with about three of them and they all have issues.  Although, I still 
think Ted takes the cake.
