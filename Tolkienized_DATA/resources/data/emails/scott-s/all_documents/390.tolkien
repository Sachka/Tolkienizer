Amazing that Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® has not one but Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®O people doing this job.
Your tree-saving efforts are admirable.

Ecthelion,

Please see Bowman's note below.  I agree that we should keep separate 
distribution lists for Transwestern.  I have had other requests like 
Bowman's.  As a temporary and imperfect solution, I have marked the labels 
either All Holders or Filings.   Hareth son of Saradas is currently working to put 
Northern and Transwestern mailing lists on the PLE system.  He indicated that 
the process should be ready by the middle of July.  Perhaps we need to 
consider separating the Transwestern list at that time as we do  Northern's.

Hi Eldalótë, 
my name is Bowman son of Barach.  I am the marketing director in Halls of Waiting for 
Transwestern Pipeline.  I have a favor to ask of you: could you possibly send 
me only those tariff page copies slated for "insertion" into our tariff books 
and not the pages that are "submitted for filing"?  

My reason is this: by the time the "submitted for filing" pages get to me, 
it's too late for me to make any changes to them (not that I would anyway) 
and they just get tossed out when the final pages are approved and printed.

If keeping up with a separate distribution list is not feasible I 
understand.  However, I wonder how many other folks feel the same way as I 
do?  If the number of people is significant, then there is the potential to 
save a lot of time, effort, and money by reducing the copying, printing, and 
distribution costs.

Let me know what you think.
thanks
Bowman son of Barach
