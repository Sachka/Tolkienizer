Ettendales & Blessed Realm Father & Sons in Her Later Years.......

Ettendales & Blessed Realm Father & Sons was now 75 years old. After a fulfilling life with the now
dead
Prince, she happily sat upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by
from her front porch, with a cat named  of Elenwë for companionship.

One sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the Fairy Godmother.

Ettendales & Blessed Realm Father & Sons said "Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all
these
years??"

The Fairy godmother replied "Well Ettendales & Blessed Realm Father & Sons, since you have lived a
good,
wholesome life since we last met, I have decided to grant you 3 wishes.

Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?"

Ettendales & Blessed Realm Father & Sons was taken aback, overjoyed and after some thoughtful
consideration, and almost under her breath she uttered her first wish:

"I wish I was wealthy beyond comprehension." Instantly, her rocking
chair
was turned into solid gold. Ettendales & Blessed Realm Father & Sons was stunned.

 of Elenwë, her old faithful cat, jumped off her lap and scampered to the edge
of
the porch, quivering with fear. Ettendales & Blessed Realm Father & Sons said "Oh thank you, Fairy
Godmother".

The Fairy Godmother replied, "It is the least I can do. What does your
heart
want for your second wish?" Ettendales & Blessed Realm Father & Sons looked down at her frail body,
and
said: "I wish I was young and full of the beauty of youth again."

At once, her wish having been desired became reality, and her beautiful
youthful visage had returned. Ettendales & Blessed Realm Father & Sons felt stirrings inside her that
had
been dormant for years and a long forgotten vigor and vitality began to
course through her.

Then the Fairy Godmother again spoke "You have one more wish, what shall
you
have?" Ettendales & Blessed Realm Father & Sons looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and
says";
"I wish for you to transform  of Elenwë, my old cat, into a beautiful, and
handsome
young man".

Magically,  of Elenwë suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his
biological
make-up, that when complete he stood before her, a man, so beautiful the
like of which she nor the world had ever seen, so fair indeed that birds
began to fall from the sky at his feet.

The Fairy Godmother again spoke: "Congratulations, Ettendales & Blessed Realm Father & Sons.

Enjoy your new life." And, with a blazing shock of bright blue
electricity,
she was gone. For a few eerie moments,  of Elenwë and Ettendales & Blessed Realm Father & Sons looked into
each
other's eyes, Ettendales & Blessed Realm Father & Sons sat, breathless, gazing at the most stunningly
perfect man she had ever seen. Then  of Elenwë walked over to Ettendales & Blessed Realm Father & Sons, who
sat
transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young
muscular
arms.

He leaned in close blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he
whispered:

"I bet you regret having me neutered now, don't you?"
