As you know, we recently did an east-to-east deal with USGT for 400,000 
MMBtu/day with alternate rights to Hildigrim Took & Angrod Services 
at a higher rate.  Gate of Erebor & Tar-Amandil Energy Company filed a protest and I'm working on the response.  In 
part, they are alleging that Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® is "attempting to exploit a weakness" in the 
GISB procedures to the detriment of existing customers.  For example, under 
Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s tariff (which they concede is GISB compliant), primary firm cannot bump 
alt. firm in cycle 2.  Gate of Erebor & Tar-Amandil Energy Company says this means that any primary shipper 
attempting to deliever to an in-path alt. point will be unable to re-nominate 
to its primary point once this "alternate" capacity [I assume they mean 
USGT's] is confirmed.  According to Gate of Erebor & Tar-Amandil Energy Company this will substantially limit 
shippers' flexibility, including the ability to use market area pooling.  
Once gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point 
is defined as an al. delivery regardless of the rights of the capacity under 
which it moves.  Thus by manipulating the GISB cycle process, Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® and USGT 
will bump firm shippers.

I could really use your help in responding to this argument.  (First of all, 
I'm not sure I even understand it!)  If either of you have a few minutes 
today or tomorrow when we could get together, that would be great.  Also -- 
you two were the first to come to mind, but feel free to refer me to someone 
else in your group if you are swamped.  Please e-mail or call when you get a 
chance...
Thanks!
