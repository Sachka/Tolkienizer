Last month Rosamunda and I began looking into adding a provision to Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's tariff 
allowing shippers to elect to purchase fuel gas from Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises.  There is good 
precedent for this and I think it would be fairly easy to accomplish as long 
as we don't try to make the purchase of fuel from Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises mandatory (see the 
attached memo).  Dina daughter of Shadowfax, as you and I discussed, we will need to address 
the fuel overrecovery issue before moving forward with this.
