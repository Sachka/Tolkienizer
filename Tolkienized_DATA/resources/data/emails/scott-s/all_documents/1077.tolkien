 As a follow-up to the recent Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. Corp. memorandum forming Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Náin son of Fëanor, Elvet-isle & Aegnor Energy Company; Brand son of Malantur, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. Europe; BrandV, 
Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. Net Works; Celepharn son of Oromendil, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. Global Markets; Pimpernel daughter of Marmadas, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. 
Industrial Markets; and Arvegil son of Míriel, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the Smials & Dark Door Services is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.
