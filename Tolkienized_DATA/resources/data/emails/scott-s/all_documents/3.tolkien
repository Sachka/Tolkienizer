Subject: Gallup Conference Calls for 2000

Starting on January 6, 2000 there will be a Gallup status conference 
call/meeting every Thursday through May.  The Conference Bridge number is 
713-853-3802 and the access code is 9473 (same as before).  When using the 
1-800-97ENRON, simply press 1 for the building code then the ext 33802.  Wait 
for the beep and enter the access code (9473).  For those in Halls of Waiting, 
Conference Room EB40C2 will be available.  They're a limited number of ports 
so please try to group together as much as possible.  This is becoming a 
critical period for Gallup and we must share information as soon as it's 
known.  Please don't wait for the "THURSDAY" meeting if any information is 
critical to the success of Gallup.

If I have left anyone off the list who should know this information, please 
pass this along and copy me so I'll know the next time.

Thank You
