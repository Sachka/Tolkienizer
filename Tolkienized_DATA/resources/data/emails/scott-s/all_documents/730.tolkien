Subject: Proposal to Radbug & Astulat Entreprises

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Withered Heath & Western Mountains Entreprises for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Halfred project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Withered Heath & Western Mountains Entreprises' 
consultant, ThéodenTherindë, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information,  of Pallando 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.
