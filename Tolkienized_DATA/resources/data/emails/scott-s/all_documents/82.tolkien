I'm a little uncomfortable with saying "Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® defers to the consensus position 
of the non-SoCal settlement parties" so often.  Could we just not say 
anything on those items?  Or say Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® has no comment at this time.  Would the 
other parties be put off if we were silent on these issues?

Subject: Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® position in All-Party Settlement Proposal

Attached see my marked-up version of your work product.  Mark, I think you 
did an excellent job of identifying Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s position in all of the issue in the 
GIR.  However, on editing, you'll see that I truncated some of the Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® 
comments in favor of a slightly shorter document -- particularly in those 
areas in which it was questionable whether we have a direct interest or not.  
Look over and give me your feedback.  Thanks.

I understand we're supposed to offer these comments to  of Pimpernel as soon as 
possible for possible inclusion in a 2nd generation "issue matrix?"
