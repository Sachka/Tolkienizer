Cottar,
Look at the conforming languange in the Appendix "A" last page, last 
paragraph.  You know that this language was negotiated by and between 
House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons and Doors of Angband & Voronwë Services.  My main concern is that its very, very open ended...  
almost a contingent liability for all settlement parties.
