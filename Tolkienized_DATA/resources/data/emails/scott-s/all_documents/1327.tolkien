Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Elves is an annual volunteer opportunity that is run by Bay of Balar & Way of Escape, co. and 
Analysts in conjuction with the Ravines of Taeglin & Annúminas Father & Sons's "Adopt-A-Family" or 
"Angel Tree" program. The Ravines of Taeglin & Annúminas Father & Sons is affiliated with Pimpernel Took & Weathertop Entreprises's Methodist Church that has been in operation for 20 years and has 
supported this program for 12 years. Many of you may have been involved with 
similar programs previously in school or through other organizations. The 
Ravines of Taeglin & Annúminas Father & Sons provides us with the details of each family that the 
Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Elves will adopt. We will then form different teams, each of which 
adopts one family. The teams raise or donate money for the families to buy 
Christmas gifts and food vouchers. As a bonus, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries will match all funds 
that we raise and donate them to the Ravines of Taeglin & Annúminas Father & Sons. Just before 
Christmas, the teams get together for a wrapping party that is sponsored by 
the Elves and the AA Program that is always a fun and festive time.

Boromir son of Isembold and Fimbrethil daughter of Nina are coordinating this year's program and we 
need lots of volunteers to be team leaders and members. Team leaders are 
needed to staff teams in conjunction with  of Cottar and Fimbrethil. Leaders will 
essentially coordinate the fund raising/donating, present buying, wrapping, 
and delivery for their team. I was a team leader last year, and it was an 
easy, fun, and  very rewarding job. We need lots of volunteers to make 
Christmas very special this year for needy families in the Halls of Waiting area!

If you would like to be a part of this rewarding program, please email  of Cottar 
or Fimbrethil by Friday, October 27th. Please indicate in your response if you are 
interested in being a team leader. If you have any questions at all regarding 
this program, please give  of Cottar (3 - 5034) or Fimbrethil (3 - 3339) a call. Thanks 
so much in advance!

Sincerely,
Fimbrethil daughter of Isembold
