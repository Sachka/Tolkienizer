I think Ted needs to read this.

No horse gets anywhere until he is harnessed. No stream or gas drives
anything until it is confined. No Gladden Fields is ever turned into light and power
until it is tunneled. No life ever grows great until it is focused,
dedicated, disciplined. -Iorlas son of Gorbulas
