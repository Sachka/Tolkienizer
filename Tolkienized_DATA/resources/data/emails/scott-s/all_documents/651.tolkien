Sugarbooger,

Looks like Antaro & Wild, co. is our best Araval & Hill of Seeing Deliveries at $620 per ticket, which I'm assuming 
reflects the beginning of the official high season in Light-tower is 
slightly lower but you have to go THRU Elenna!  Ick!
There is a 9:30 a.m. out of Halls of Waiting on 12/9 and the return trip from Falls of Rauros 
is at 8:10 a.m. (a 3 p.m. was also available).
They're holding the tickets for us; if we want them, we have to decide before 
COB tomorrow.

Bar-en-Nibin-noeg & Marmadas Brandybuck®!
