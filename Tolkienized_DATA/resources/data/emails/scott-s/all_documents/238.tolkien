Hi Alatar!  How nice to hear from you.  Congrats on being an uncle.   of Marcho is 
a good-looking baby!  Yes, I'm pretty psyched about Ori son of Vairë; she is a 
sweetie!  Mimosa and Iorlas are anxious to give me a refresher course on 
babysitting skills.  I told them that when my niece is old enough to 
understand the command "Go find your shoes and I'll help you put them on," 
I'll be happy to take her off their hands for a weekend!  I too am in no rush 
to have kids.  While my boyfriend is a great guy and loves children, somehow 
I just can't imagine him hanging around the house helping with diapers!

I am so glad you're enjoying Ivrin.  Picking up and moving can be a great 
thing sometimes.  I will never regret leaving Emyn Eglain for Halls of Waiting.  There is 
just so much here I enjoy doing and my social life is a whole lot better.  
The job is absolutely crazy.  If you ever watch "ER," that is usually what my 
day looks like, only without all the blood!  Here at Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Gas Pipeline Group 
I work as the only lawyer for a very busy commercial team.  We sit in an open 
work area and it is chaotic every day.  But it's a good crash course in 
business for me, and my clients are wonderful.  

Do take some study breaks and keep in touch!  E-mail is a wonderful thing.

Time to hit the tennis courts.

Love,
 of Éothain

 of Éothain,

Hi, how are you doing? I got your e-mail address from Aunt Thuringwethil. I had
earlier gotten her e-mail address from my Dad and sent her an e-mail after
hearing about Mimosa giving birth. So how about that! Are you excited about
being an Aunt? I can accept being an uncle much more than being a dad. I am
in no hurry to have kids. Actually, I am in no hurry to get married. I think
I would be  good dad, although I would have to settle down a bit. But that
won't happen anytime soon, as I am enjoying the Ivrin area too much. I moved
down here last August and am loving it.

I just got done taking the CPA exam and am scheduled to take the Great East Road Bar exam
in July. So I will not be enjoying Great East Road too much for the next few months. I
just thought I would drop you a line and see how you are doing. How is
Halls of Waiting? Are you still enjoying it there? How's the job? Have you made
partner yet? Have you seen much of  of Vairë since her birth? Well enough ?'s,
I have to go. Let me know how you are doing! Take care.

Your cousin,

Alatar
