Just a note to alert you.  Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services will be filing a protest in Transwestern's
filing in this docket.  Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services objects to Transwestern's proposal to not permit
netting and trading of imbalances on a volumetric basis.  This is one of the
issues Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services protested in Transwestern's Order 637 filing.
