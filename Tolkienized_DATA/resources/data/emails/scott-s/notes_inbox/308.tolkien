Marmadas'S REPORTS: Baggage must be checked at the airport prior to flight 
departure -- but how early?  Some airlines dictate specific time ranges 
during which baggage must be checked in order for it to be loaded on the same 
flight as the passenger.  Others do not.  Haudh-en-Elleth Airline Expert Beren son of Chica reviews the rules and restrictions in his latest edition of "Airline 
News."  Click to

Beechbone son of Andwise: Our newest column from Haudh-en-Elleth's own Frugalist, Haldan
 of Tanta, features up-to-the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles 
and save you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

How to get the most miles out of your flying:

1) Identify your likes and dislikes and pick a carrier/alliance to meet those 
needs.  Once you have a carrier, they will do their best to keep you through 
various promotions and coupons.  Stick with that carrier/alliance even though 
you might find that another airline beats them by $10.  This can become a 
"penny wise, pound foolish" situation if you are trying to achieve elite 
status, which brings with it additional "free" miles.

2) Join any discount programs for which you qualify or programs like Two Kingdoms 
Club for further discounts.

3) Consider alternative airports served by your alliance whenever you can.  
This can save you hundreds of dollars for a drive of just an hour or so.

4) Since you are working with an alliance, check the other airline partners.  
That is, if you see Antaro & Wild, co. flights on Azanulbizar, they may actually 
be flights operated by Goldilocks Gardner & Isilmë, co..  You buy a ticket on Antaro & Wild, co. from 
Azanulbizar and end up flying on your primary carrier, Goldilocks Gardner & Isilmë, co..  This 
practice is called code sharing.

5) Consider open jaw and circle routes instead of two one-way or two 
roundtrip tickets.  Use rail travel on the open portions of these types of 
tickets if you can, and remember that you can earn miles on a few rail routes 
depending on your carrier.

6) If you do fly four to six roundtrips per year on your carrier/alliance, it 
is quite possible to achieve elite status which brings with it additional 
miles and that wonder of wonders, the first class upgrade.

7) But most of all, in order to get the most benefit from leisure travel and 
the best price as well, be flexible when you travel.

Next week, tips for picking your hotel and rental car partners wisely.

Happy Contrails,
Haldan "Mr. Maximiler"  of Tanta
