I need to get expense reports in by the 13th of this month.  Have you given 
me all of your receipts for this year?  The only receipt I currently have to 
send in for reimbursement is your Porto Baggins & Dimrill Dale© bill dated 11/15/00.  Is that it?  
It looks like your December bill will have to be submitted after the cutoff 
date.
