Looks OK to me, subject to approval from MKM's group.  Should we also solicit 
turnback in the Arthedain area in addition to soliciting it from Cracks of Doom. 
border to Gundabald?  Is it our theory that since Thor.-Cracks of Doom is the constrained 
segment, thats the only area we need to solicit turnback on?  DF
