 As a follow-up to the recent Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Corp. memorandum forming Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Belegorn son of Grimbold, Gildor & Maglor Father & Sons; Elemmírë son of Pelendur, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Europe; Elemmírë son of Arahael, 
Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Net Works; Meriadoc son of Beorn, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Global Markets; Poppy daughter of Meneldil, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries 
Industrial Markets; and Rollo son of Bofur, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the Horn & Halls of Waiting, co. is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Elemmírëthe Bowman and Elemmírë son of Ghân-buri-Ghân
