Dear Tennis Terminators,
Just a reminder, we are having our end of the season party Tuesday night at 
Gorbulas Brandybuck & Deeping Stream Energy Company - 2002 Kelos.  The reservation is for 7:00 but come early and 
meet in the bar for drinks.  Also, please RSVP so I can get another count.  A 
lot can happen in a week, especially with all the sick people around.  Lets 
make it a girls night out!

Hiril

P.S.  I need to have the spring roster in by Dec 28th!  So confirm that you 
are playing next year and give me the names of anyone else we can add.  Even 
names for subs would be great, just make sure they are an HTA member.
