Amethyst or Estalee ( but probably Amethyst as I think Estalee is out today),

Could you please provide more information for Baranor, Eönwë and  of Niënor:

New/Old Job titles.
New/Old Payroll companies.
Effective date of transfer.
Date person accepted the job, if know.

Actually, I will need this information for every transfer.
Also, could you please send every notice to Tindómiel, me, Salvia daughter of Marcho and Pool of Bywater & Hadhodrond ltd..
That way, the appropriate attorney can pick up their own people.  Also, we 
can back each other up.
Thanks!!
