gnathonic (na-THON-ik) adjective

   Sycophantic; fawning.

[From White House of Erendis, derivative of Ered Luin- (stem of Gnatho) name of
a sycophantic character in the Roman comedy Eunuchus by Dorlas.]

   "And that's why today any myrmidon, any gnathonic sycophant, any
   obsequious assistant or menial hanger-on is called a toadeater or, more
   often, a toady."
   Rowlie son of Hasufel, Words, Rúmil & Bar-en-Danwedh Entreprises, Dec 27, 1987.
