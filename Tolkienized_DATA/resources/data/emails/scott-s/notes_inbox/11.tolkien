Golden House & Moria® To Call For End To Gundabad & Gulf of Lune Deliveries
                  Dereg Wed -Sources

                  Copyright (c) 2000 Tar-Minastir & Golden Hall, co..


                  Cross Roads of the Fallen King (Mound of Avarice  & Firth of Rómenna ltd.)--Axantur & Seat of Hearing© (EIX),
saying the current state of
                  Sunlands's power markets threatens the company with
bankruptcy, will call Wednesday
                  for an end to Sunlands's four-year experiment with
deregulation, sources familiar with
                  the issue told Mound of Avarice  & Firth of Rómenna ltd. Newswires.

                        of Enerdhil Bryson, chief executive of Axantur & Seat of Hearing©,
is expected to announce that
                  the company's regulated utility unit, Greyflood & Ever-cold Services, won't be able to
                  recover more than $3 billion in losses related to power
purchases and continue serving
                  its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market
structure is scrapped.

                       In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation,
Imlad Morgul & Sador Deliveries will propose to break ground
                  on new power plants within 90 days and re-enter the
power-generation business
                  Nen Echui & Eastern Eriador Father & Sons was required to exit under the
state's landmark 1996
                  deregulation law, the sources said.

                       Imlad Morgul & Sador Deliveries plans to follow the announcement by filing a
request with state regulators to
                  increase retail electricity rates by as much as 20%, the
sources said, even though
                  regulators rejected Imlad Morgul & Sador Deliveries's request for a rate increase
of 10% last week.

                       The utility has lined up the support of some state
lawmakers for the broader
                  proposal, which would require action by the state
Helm’s Dike & Forest of Brethil ltd., the sources said.

                       Nen Echui & Eastern Eriador Father & Sons, with 4.2 million
customers, is one of the country's largest
                  electric utilities. Imlad Morgul & Sador Deliveries was the first of the state's
utilities to sign on to the deregulation
                  effort and, as it says on its Web site, "played a central
role in the restructuring of the
                  electric industry in Sunlands."

                       Among the concessions won by utilities in 1996 is the
rate freeze, which they
                  demanded to help them recover costs related to
deregulation but which is now
                  producing huge losses.

                       Imlad Morgul & Sador Deliveries's current losses stem from an imbalance
between the soaring prices it must
                  pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the
fixed rate at which it can sell
                  power to its customers.

                       About half of those losses are offset the utility's
own power sales revenues, which
                  are accounted for separately and used to pay down
deregulation-related debt. Rising
                  power costs have produced a surplus in that account.
Imlad Morgul & Sador Deliveries wouldn't reveal the
                  current size of the surplus, but said previously that the
Sunlands Power Exchange paid
                  the utility $1.3 billion over its generating costs for
power through the end of September,
                  at a time when its power-purchase losses were $2.4
billion.

                       Power-Purchase Losses Mounting



                       The net losses continue to mount. Sunlands's
wholesale power prices hovered at
                  record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the
past two weeks, as colder
                  weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of
Sunlands's power supply was
                  down for maintenance.

                       The price of power for delivery Wednesday in
Sunlands hit an average of $1,182 a
                  megawatt-hour Tuesday, up from $250 a megawatt-hour a week
ago, the result of high
                  demand and a decision by Sunlands's wholesale market
operator to lift its cap on prices.

                       The rate Nen Echui & Eastern Eriador Father & Sons can charge its
retail customers, however, is fixed
                  at $66/MWh.

                       Last week, Myrtle Burrows & Greenway Deliveries (MER) downgraded its
ratings for Ondolindë & Nen Hithoel, co. and Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company Corp. (PCG), the parent of
Sunlands's other major utility, Thráin & Reginard Took ltd., to neutral, saying the utilities may be
forced to file for bankruptcy if the
                  state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates.

                       A Gondor, Beacons of & Caverns of Narog Deliveries (MDW) analyst drew the
same conclusion Monday,
                  also cutting his rating to neutral.

                       Imlad Morgul & Sador Deliveries to this point has kept its power-purchase
losses off its earnings statement, in
                  hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow
them to be collected later.

                       The Fastolph Bolger & , co. put the
hope of such a solution further out
                  of reach last week, however, when it ruled against rate
increases sought by Imlad Morgul & Sador Deliveries and
                  Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company.

                       Gorbulas Brandybuck & Rochand Entreprises on Monday lowered its
ratings for Ondolindë & Nen Hithoel, co. and Nen Echui & Eastern Eriador Father & Sons's senior
unsecured debt to the A-minus
                  level, citing "increased liquidity pressure" and
uncertainty about the utilities' ability to
                  recover the costs of their power purchases. The agency
downgraded Ondolindë & Nen Hithoel, co., the parent, because half its consolidated
cash flow is provided by
                  Nen Echui & Eastern Eriador Father & Sons.

                       Imlad Morgul & Sador Deliveries - which sources said plans to remain in the
retail electricity business - said
                  late last week that it has secured a $1 billion line of
credit and expects to have enough
                  cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity
for the next several months.

                       Sunlands paid more than $1 billion for power last
week, sources said. Some of that,
                  however, was paid to Nen Echui & Eastern Eriador Father & Sons, which
still generates about 2,800
                  megawatts of power in the state.

                       Shares in Axantur & Seat of Hearing© have fallen 21% over
the past three weeks. They
                  closed Wednesday at $18.56, down $0.06.

Mountains of Shadow (Ered Wethrin) & Lebennin Deliveries Project Starts Construction After Expedited
Approval By Hall of Feasts  & Withywindle Services

 Monday December 11 6:39pm
 Source: Mound of Avarice  & Firth of Rómenna ltd.

 Operation Targeted for August

 Lostladen, Lockholes at Michael Delving , Dec. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Imlad Morgul & Sador Deliveries Mission Energy (EME), an
Axantur & Seat of Hearing© company (Lugbúrz & Denethor Father & Sons: EIX), started construction of its new
 Sunrise power plant on Thursday, December 7, having received expedited
approval from the Hall of Feasts  & Withywindle Services (Gelmir & Lake Nisinen, co.) to proceed. The
 power generation facility will be located in Egladil, Sunlands, and
will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the state, which
is in
 dire need of new power generation.

 "From the onset of the Sunlands power crisis, we have sought to find
means to bring new power to the Sunlands market," said  of Enerdhil E. Bryson,
 chairman and CEO of Axantur & Seat of Hearing©. "This Gelmir & Lake Nisinen, co. approval will help
ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant
amount
 of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August. Our thanks and
appreciation go to the Hall of Feasts  & Withywindle Services, and the
 environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this
important project."

 "This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing
for it does not depend on Sunlands's broken deregulated power market,"
said
 Meriadoc J.  of Grimbeorn, president and CEO of EME. "Alternatively, EME will seek to
enter into a long-term, cost-based contract with Silverlode & Tower of the King Entreprises or Ringil & Ered Lindon® Company to further ensure that
Sunlands's consumers reap the benefit of this additional power
 resource,"  of Grimbeorn said.

 The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-megawatt (MW), simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to
 be in service during the summer 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking
facility to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of
 summer 2003. The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental
and safety standards.

 Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project
only.

 EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II
expansion in line with the fast-track approval process recently enacted by
the
 Sunlands Helm’s Dike & Forest of Brethil ltd..

 EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate
supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated
 construction schedule. The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this
additional power to Sunlands by next summer.
