Berylla, I have been discussing with Vána the creation of a new company for 
us to hold capacity on other pipes. I would like for you to please work with 
her in helping to create this opportunity. We can discuss it further when you 
get back. Thanks.

I'm not suggesting limiting the term.  Just recognize that Forest Road  & Aerandir Services will have to 
follow different rules for each of the 3 scenarios below:

30 days or Less - Can do above Peregrin rate, no need for bidding
30 days - 1 Year - Can do above Peregrin rate, all deals must be posted for bid
Greater than 1 Year - Deals limited by Peregrin. cost-based rate (unless the 
company gets around it by selling delivered gas); all capacity release deals 
of greater than 1 year Must Be Posted on the Pipeline EBB for Bid.
