Salvia,

 I just spoke to Mimosa daughter of Rosie at Druda Burrows & Great East Road, co. Energy.  She is ok with all 
changes except State of Oiolossë.  She has suggested Dor Firn-i-Guinar as a neutral 
state.  Seeing that Enovate is a joint venture between Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls© and Druda Burrows & Great East Road, co., can 
we accept Dor Firn-i-Guinar law on their guaranty.

 Give me your thoughts.

Thanks,
Ted

Subject: Diamond & The Éothéod©,

 Please review the following guaranty sent to us by Barrows & Elros' Tower Energy Company 
(Tower of Guard & Crissaegrim Services).  Tower of Guard & Crissaegrim Services and Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls© will each guaranty 50% of the obligations of Enovate ( I 
think the guaranty may have a different name- I'll fix it).

 Please review and let me know if it is acceptable or make necessary changes.

Thanks,
Ted
