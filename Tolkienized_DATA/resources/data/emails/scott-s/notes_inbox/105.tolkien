There's a typo on my vacation.  It's no biggie, but I just wanted to let you 
know.  I'm taking Dec. 27, not 22, but no need to re-send the list unless you 
get a bunch more corrections.

Attached, FYI, is the holiday schedule for the 2 weeks covering the Christmas 
and New Year period.  If you want to print it for your people, it's on 8-1/2 
x 14"/landscape.  Eilinel
