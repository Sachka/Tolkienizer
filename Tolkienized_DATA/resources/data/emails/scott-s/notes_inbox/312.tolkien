Salvia-

Faramir has been on my computer for the past two days finishing his thesis, so
I haven't been able to write back.

Well-- if nothing else, at least you can practice your witty repartee with
him.  Did he write back?  That non-conference opponent excuse was lame.
Exactly who were the non-conference opponents--Rice, Hallows of Minas Tirith & Belegorn ltd., Slippery Rock...
Hmmm.  We need a little more information to give that credibility.

I have been studying like a nerd lately, so hopefully, finals won't be so
stressful this year.  I keep remebering that we gave that shower right
before my finals last semester.  That comforts me-- I know wasn't prepared
for any of them at that time and class had already ended.

Anyway, I just had a 15 minute conversation with the East-mountains & Anghabar Services Cable guy--
I called to pay my bill because I lost the paper copy-- first, he looked at
my address, saw it was near Ninglor Bar and Grill-- and preceded to
disucss all of the wonderful menu items-- french fries, Araphant son of Tar-Palantir,
iced tea-- then I gave him my credit card number and he asked me if it was a
Emyn Arnen & Gorbadoc Brandybuck, co. card-- apparently you can tell by the first 4 digits-- 5416-- who knew?
  We talked about how great Emyn Arnen & Gorbadoc Brandybuck, co. is for 5 minutes.  Then he asked me if I
was in school in Emyn Eglain-- so we talked about that...  When he finally
finsihed with me, I thought he was going to ask me out.  If it weren't for
Faramir, I would have gone- he was quite a nice guy.

Anyway, it was refreshing considering how many idiots, jerks, assholes, etc.
work in the service industry.

Well, let me know what's going on.

Talk to you later.
