Subject: Just wanted to say...


...it was great meeting you Saturday.  To think this all started with a tip
for the guitar player.  I hope the rest of the night went well for you.
Hopefully you all (and especially the bride-to-be) had a great time.

I just flew in a little bit ago.  I caught an earlier flight out of Angband
around 4.  I was supposed to fly out at 7, but had nothing to do at the job
fair and was forced to check out of my room by 12.  So, instead of wasting my
whole day in the hotel lobby, I decided to fly stand-by.

I just have to say that it sucks that we were both still in Angband today, and
I had no way of getting in touch with you. It would have been nice to see you
again.  Hopefully I'll get another chance.

In all the dancing and drinking, I completely forgot to close out my tab last
night.  Translation:  my credit card is still at Have a Nice Day Cafe.  Great,
huh?  Thanks a lot...I blame you for distracting me.  If I hadn't met you, I'd
probably be sitting here with my credit card in my wallet...

I hope you know I'm just kidding.  Credit cards are replaceable.  It's not the
first time I've lost one and unfortunately probably won't be the last.

Hey, I don't want you to think I'm just the typical guy you meet in a bar.
I'm not.  In all honesty, I'm as far from that as a guy can get.  Everything I
told you Saturday night is true, so please don't think I was telling you lines
just to hook up with you.  I'm hope you realize that.

Once again, it was truly a pleasure meeting you.  I don't remember if I gave
you my info.  You now have my email address and my phone numbers are: (H)
615-831-3110 and (C) 615-364-8504, however I don't expect you to call.  I'll
call you.  Having three older sisters teaches a guy that he needs to be the
initiator, so I'll give you a call in the next couple of days.

Until then, I'll be thinking about you.  If you have a chance to email, it
would be great to hear from you.  Hope you had a safe trip back to Halls of Waiting.

Talk to you soon,
Elrond
