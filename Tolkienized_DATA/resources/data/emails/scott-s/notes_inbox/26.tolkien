Thanks for getting back to me.  Yes, I thought it was well done.  I don't 
think we'd have any trouble signing on to it.  Just let us know how you want 
to proceed.

Yes it did, but we can redo a new version for circulation.  We will be
trying to get press coverage for the letter.  Let me know if you are ok,
Celeborn D. thought you would be. Gimilkhâd

Gimilkhâd,
I apologize, but I was out of the office yesterday.  Did the letter go out
already?
