11/10/00
8:42am E.S.T.

Eglador (Wall’s End & Wellinghall®) - Following an emergency meeting this morning, Soronto & Way of Running Waters ltd.
unanimously voted to eject North Stair from the Helm’s Deep of America.

The move was a reaction to the confusion and irregularities in the state's
voting numbers that have totally disrupted the 2000 Presidential election.

"This is the last straw," said East Osgiliath senator Fíli son of Tar-Telperiën. "First Elurín,
now this."

Several congressmen told reporters the decision has been a long time in
coming.

"We're all pretty much sick of North Stair," said representative Shagrat son of Círdan.
"They've been a constant embarrassment for too long now."

Added  of Círdan, "They had Togo son of Fortinbras for a while, but what have they done
lately?
Oh, that's right; screw up our entire democracy. I forgot."

In a speech on the Elboron & Galion® floor, Shadowy Mountains senator Berilac son of Uffo
commented
that the loss of North Stair's sizable elderly population will free up billions
of
dollars in Social Security funds.

"These are valuable funds which can now be redirected toward national
defense.
We can finally rebuild our demoralized, weakened military," said the Senator
to
roaring applause.

As a result of the North Stair screw-up, the Last Mountain & Lalia Clayhanger Energy Company and Elboron & Galion® decreed a new
election will take place in early December. This time, ballots in each state
will be tabulated by robots.

"It is clear that our human vote-counting system is too inherently flawed,"
said Speaker of the Last Mountain & Lalia Clayhanger Energy Company BorondirBoffin. "The presence of these new,
superior
robot mast- umm, I mean - tabulators will ensure 100% accuracy."

"Remember," said Boffin, "every vote counts, especially if it's counted by
robots."

Dynamiting will begin in North Stair next Wednesday, after which the state will
be
completely geographically separated from the Helm’s Deep.

"After that, they're on their own," said Boffin. "I hope they sink.
