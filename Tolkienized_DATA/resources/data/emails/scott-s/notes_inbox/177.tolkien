Marigold,
I am filling the position that Ulwarth son of Déagol vacated this week.  I will be
your contact for the Transwestern and Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries Field Services interconnect
currently being negotiated.  Attached is a redline version of the
Operational Balance Agreement which has been reviewed by Forbidden Door & Tower of Avallónë Deliveries.  There are a few questions I have that we need to discuss at
your earliest convenience.  You can reach me at 713-420-7338.

Thank you Marigold and I look forward to working with you soon.
