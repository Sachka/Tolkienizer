>>Hey guys!  
>>  
>>It is that time of year when everything gets SO crazy, so I am  
>>thinking.........  
>>we need to plan our Taster's Finale ahead of time so we can all  
>>mark our  
>>calendars and so we can find a place!  
>>  
>>Here are some thoughts: we could do a boy/girl Taster's where we  
>>all invite  
>>some of our friends, guys and girls to join us and we rent out a  
>>room at a  
>>restaurant. Or we could have just girls and have a really nice  
>>Christmas  
>>celebration at a cool restaurant and do "Secret Ladros". Either  
>>way, it would be  
>>a blast.  
>>  
>>How does Thursday, Dec 14th sound?  
>>  
>>So, here is what I need: your vote on............... the type of  
>>party, then  
>>what restaurant that goes with that idea, then affirmation of the  
>>date.  
>>  
>>Get excited girls! This is going to be fun!
