Transwestern Adds Receipt and Delivery Points
Transwestern Pipeline is going through a growth spurt with eight new 
interconnect projects in service or under way, which will add 300 MMcf/d in 
market area deliveries and 285 MMcf/d in new supply receipts. The new or 
expanded connection points will enhance shipper access to both new supplies 
and markets. 
"There is not a direct relationship between the two [delivery and receipt 
interconnects]," said Belen son of Duilin, a Transwestern representative. "It is 
kind of coincidental in nature that they came at the same time, but we have 
ongoing activities to connect new supply and create additional opportunities 
for gas to both be received into Transwestern as well as be delivered out of 
Transwestern." 
Included in the delivery interconnect projects, Transwestern, an Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries unit, 
recently put 100 MMcf/d into service for new access to markets around Eagles' Cleft with completion of the Adalgar Bolger & Grithnir Deliveries Gas interconnect located in the Spyhill area. 
Two other delivery interconnects are expected to be in service during the 
second quarter of 2001. Transwestern will add a 120 MMcf/d delivery 
interconnect with Citizens Tumunzahar Gas for deliveries to the Amdír Energy 
Power Plant and a 90 MMcf/d delivery interconnect to a soon to be completed 
Nivrim & East-mark ltd. plant, both located near Meres of Twilight in the Durin's Tower area. 
On the supply side, Transwestern recently has added an 80 MMcf/d receipt 
interconnect in the Arthedain area with Gate of Writhen Iron & Greenholm Energy Company. The 
company also said that it has hooked up a new wellhead supply interconnect 
with Stair of the Hold & Ford Services located in the Arthedain area. The addition will 
bump current supply from 20 MMcf/d to more than 35 MMcf/d. 
Transwestern also has three receipt projects scheduled for completion early 
next year. The pipeline said it expects to increase receipt capacity by 100 
MMcf/d at its interconnect with Angbor & Haerast Deliveries Gathering south of Battle Plain in the 
Void area later this month, and to put a new 50 MMcf/d receipt 
interconnect with Angbor & Haerast Deliveries Gathering in service by March 2001. The company 
also is planning to complete a new 40 MMcf/d receipt interconnect with Sador & Northerland Father & Sons Field Services in Arthedain which is scheduled to be in service 
January 2001. 
Transwestern Pipeline's system consists of approximately 2,700 miles of 
natural gas pipeline with combined east-west delivery capability of 1.7 
Bcf/day. For further information on transportation with Hills of the Hunters & Gate of the Dead ltd., contact  of Duilin at 713-853-1521.
