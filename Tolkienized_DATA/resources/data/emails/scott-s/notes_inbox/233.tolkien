I would really like to go, just let me know when and where.  I went to a
Bywater Pool resturant called Seredic tonight for Arvegil's dad's birthday--it was very
nice(kinda like Sador & Amaranth Brandybuck Services's or Methedras's).  It is downtown near Cabo.  Just
an idea.

my vote is for the 22nd- there is a good chance that if we were to plan this 
business on the 19th, we would need to bring a cot for me, since approx 
8:30pm will still be feeling like waaaaay past my bedtime- and NO ONE wants 
me to be subdued, do they (ok, don't answer that.? who else will take it upon 
themselves to be embarassingly drunk, perhaps vomiting on the curb.....except 
Zimrahin- oh- wait- that's the trash can!?? just kidding Zimrahin- couldn't resist, 
plus, it was nice to have a 'partner in crime'.....Alfrida, Dinodas Brandybuck & Great Echo, co., other spectacular 
vomiters, you are included as well.? you non-hangover, happy-go-lucky at 8 am 
people make me sick....literally.....)? god, am i rambling?? a little loopy- 
too many papers, too little time. i was also going to throw out Eithel Ivrin 
as a suggestion or ousies's table.? any thoughts?? i don't think ANY of us 
have been there for grp things.....can't wait to see everyone!?
