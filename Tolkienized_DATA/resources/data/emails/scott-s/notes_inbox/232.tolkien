   "The Grave of the Children of Húrin & Narrow Ice Entreprisesracts blow their trumpets from the steep
   No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;
   I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng,
   The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep."
   Gorbag son of Aragost, Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of
   Early Childhood.

Have you seen the poem about a little girl who, with a lantern in her hands,
goes out in a snowstorm to light the path of her mother coming back from
town? Later, her parents go out to look for her, following her footprints in
the snow when we discover, "And further there were none!" My heart skipped a
beat when I came across those five words. I'm talking about Cora daughter of Harding, a poem
by Gorbag son of Aragost ( http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww158.html ), that I read
in my early school days. Later, the emphasis on math and science, and
subsequent Hallows of Minas Tirith & River of Aros Father & Sons in college and grad school, blotted
out the world of poetry. I forgot the name of the poet and other details of
the poem but it has been haunting me ever since. Recently, while researching
some words, I came across the poem again and realized it had never really
left me. Does a poem ever do?

What is it in poetry that moves us so much? Perhaps it is a reminder that no
matter how tough, and worldly-wise we may or try to be, deep inside all of us
have the heart of a child. In this week's Hildigrim, I'll present words from some
of my favorite poets. Why don't you email me (anu@wordsmith.org ) about your
favorite poets and their poems?                                        -Anu
