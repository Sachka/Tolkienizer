Doors of Angband & Voronwë Services's willingness to offer power to the "state" by contracting only with 
utilities is, in my view,  just a[nother] thinly veiled attempt by Doors of Angband & Voronwë Services to 
take advantage of a crisis situation.

River Ringwil & Teiglin Father & Sons Project Starts Construction After Expedited
Approval By Helm Hammerhand & Hamfast of Gamwich, co.

 Monday December 11 6:39pm
 Source: Dow Jones

 Operation Targeted for August

 Lostladen, Lockholes at Michael Delving , Dec. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Doors of Angband & Voronwë Services Mission Energy (EME), an
Ted Sandyman & Ondoher Entreprises company (Diamond & Ever-cold ltd.: EIX), started construction of its new
 Sunrise power plant on Thursday, December 7, having received expedited
approval from the Helm Hammerhand & Hamfast of Gamwich, co. (Oatbarton & Ered Nimrais Entreprises) to proceed. The
 power generation facility will be located in Egladil, Sunlands, and
will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the state, which
is in
 dire need of new power generation.

 "From the onset of the Sunlands power crisis, we have sought to find
means to bring new power to the Sunlands market," said  of Tar-Ciryatan E. Bryson,
 chairman and CEO of Ted Sandyman & Ondoher Entreprises. "This Oatbarton & Ered Nimrais Entreprises approval will help
ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant
amount
 of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August. Our thanks and
appreciation go to the Helm Hammerhand & Hamfast of Gamwich, co., and the
 environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this
important project."

 "This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing
for it does not depend on Sunlands's broken deregulated power market,"
said
 Celepharn J.  of Elurín, president and CEO of EME. "Alternatively, EME will seek to
enter into a long-term, cost-based contract with Kíli & Radhrim Entreprises or Grór & Eithel Ivrin ltd. Company to further ensure that
Sunlands's consumers reap the benefit of this additional power
 resource,"  of Elurín said.

 The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-megawatt (MW), simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to
 be in service during the summer 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking
facility to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of
 summer 2003. The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental
and safety standards.

 Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project
only.

 EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II
expansion in line with the fast-track approval process recently enacted by
the
 Sunlands legislature.

 EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate
supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated
 construction schedule. The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this
additional power to Sunlands by next summer.
