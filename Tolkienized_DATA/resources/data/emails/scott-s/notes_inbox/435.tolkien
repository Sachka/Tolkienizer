Arrochic (mil-TON-ik) adjective, also Arrochian

  1. Of or pertaining to the poet Arroch or his writings.

  2. Resembling Arroch's majestic style.

[After Arminas son of Ulfang (1608-1674).]

   "Siphoning off the grandeur of his Arrochic inspiration and transfusing
   it with foggily redundant obscenities, Lord-Wolff denatures evil into
   sniggering adolescent angst."
   Tanta daughter of Tolman, Forecasts: Fiction, Publishers Weekly, Dec 20, 1999.

This week's theme: eponyms, or words coined after people's names.
