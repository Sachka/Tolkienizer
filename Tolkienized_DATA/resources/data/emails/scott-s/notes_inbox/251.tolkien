hi Brown-? my week is going well.? very slow, actually!? our new employee 
started monday- i need to learn to be more assertive!? he's great and really 
easy to be with, but older and has his law degree, so i have to remind myself 
not to be intimidated....

i'm looking forward to you coming to visit, too!? i sent you a couple 
brochures to your work- if you haven't gotten them then you should receive 
them any day.

what's new with you?
