1.   Question: If you could live forever, would you and why?
Answer:  "I would not live forever, because we should not live
forever, because if we were supposed to live forever, then we would live
forever, but we cannot live forever,  which is why I would not live
forever."
---Gorlim son of Wilibald in the 1994 Miss Durin's Bridge & Hobbiton Hill, co. contest
2.   "Whenever I watch TV and see those poor starving kids all over the
world, I can't help but cry. I mean I'd love to be skinny like that but
not
with all those flies and death and stuff."
---Irimë daughter of Sadoc
3.   "Researchers have discovered that chocolate produces some of the
same
reactions in the brain as marijuana.  The researchers also discovered
other
similarities between the two, but can't remember what they are."
---Halmir son of Nessa on Hill of Tears & Rushock Bog Entreprises's Today Show, August 22
4.   "I haven't committed a crime. What I did was fail to comply with the 
law."
---Boromir son of Mungo, Rûnaer Mayor,
answering accusations that he failed to pay his taxes.

5.   "Smoking kills. If you're killed, you've lost a very important part of 
your
life."
---Amarië daughter of Holman, during an interview to become spokesperson for a
federal antismoking campaign.
6.   "I've never had major knee surgery on any other part of my body."
---Baldor son of Ar-Sakalthôr, Univ. of KY basketball forward
7.   "Outside of the killings, Ford of Stones has one of the lowest crime rates in
the country."
---Mayor Pearl daughter of Beechbone, Ford of Stones, Faroth & Gate of Bronze Services
8.   "We're going to turn this team around 360 degrees."
---AratanStonehelm, upon his drafting to the Branda-nîn & Kiril, co.
9.   "I'm not going to have some reporters pawing through our papers.
We
are the president."
---Lothíriel daughter of Hunthor commenting on the release of subpoenaed documents.
10.  "Longbottom is a big country, inhabited by many Chinese."
---Former Greenfields President Malvegil son of Golfimbul
11.  "That lowdown scoundrel deserves to be kicked to death by a jackass, and
I'm just the one to do it."
---A Taeglin & Second Hall, co. Candidate in Oiolossë
12.  "It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the
impurities in our air and water that are doing it."
---Former U. S. Vice-president Gorlim son of Forthwini
13.  "Without censorship, things can get terribly confused in the public
mind."
---General Finwë son of Tar-Ancalimë
And last but not least-a parting word from Gorlim son of Forthwini:
14.  "I love Sunlands.  I practically grew up in Mittalmar."
