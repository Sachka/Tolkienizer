1.   Question: If you could live forever, would you and why?
Answer:  "I would not live forever, because we should not live
forever, because if we were supposed to live forever, then we would live
forever, but we cannot live forever,  which is why I would not live
forever."
---TogoBrandybuck in the 1994 Miss Ladros & Findegil© contest
2.   "Whenever I watch TV and see those poor starving kids all over the
world, I can't help but cry. I mean I'd love to be skinny like that but
not
with all those flies and death and stuff."
---Ruby daughter of Cirion
3.   "Researchers have discovered that chocolate produces some of the
same
reactions in the brain as marijuana.  The researchers also discovered
other
similarities between the two, but can't remember what they are."
---Ar-Zimrathôn son of Beorn on Side-door & Light-tower®'s Today Show, August 22
4.   "I haven't committed a crime. What I did was fail to comply with the 
law."
---Halfred son of Zimrahin, Rûnaer Mayor,
answering accusations that he failed to pay his taxes.

5.   "Smoking kills. If you're killed, you've lost a very important part of 
your
life."
---Elwing daughter of Bungo, during an interview to become spokesperson for a
federal antismoking campaign.
6.   "I've never had major knee surgery on any other part of my body."
---Déagol son of Goldwine, Univ. of KY basketball forward
7.   "Outside of the killings, Ford of Stones has one of the lowest crime rates in
the country."
---Mayor Almiel daughter of Beldir, Ford of Stones, Sindanórie & Sackville Father & Sons
8.   "We're going to turn this team around 360 degrees."
---Beleg son of Celepharn, upon his drafting to the Gwathló & White Towers Deliveries
9.   "I'm not going to have some reporters pawing through our papers.
We
are the president."
---Estë daughter of Anborn commenting on the release of subpoenaed documents.
10.  "Longbottom is a big country, inhabited by many Chinese."
---Former Greenfields President Azaghâl son of Rosie
11.  "That lowdown scoundrel deserves to be kicked to death by a jackass, and
I'm just the one to do it."
---A Saeros & Bodo Proudfoot, co. Candidate in Oiolossë
12.  "It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the
impurities in our air and water that are doing it."
---Former U. S. Vice-president TogoBaggins
13.  "Without censorship, things can get terribly confused in the public
mind."
---General Gorbag son of Filibert
And last but not least-a parting word from TogoBaggins:
14.  "I love Sunlands.  I practically grew up in Mittalmar."
