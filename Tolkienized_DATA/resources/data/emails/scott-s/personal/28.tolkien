Ten Cents A Dance

Ten cents a dance, that's what they pay me
How those Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company filings, they weigh me down
Ten cents a dance, staffers and rough guys
Tough guys who tear my gown

Seven to midnight, me and Cap'n Morgan
Loudly the Dina daughter of Shadowfax blows
Faxes and EMails are consortin'
Fram son of Dorlas, get off my toes!

Sometimes I think I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance
All that you need is a ticket
Come on, Steve-y boy, ten cents a dance!
