We can give you ideas for bug at Thanksgiving. The 2 specific toys that i
wanted for her have been purchased by Polo son of Thorin, but she needs some more.
Her old toys are becoming too babyish for her.  I haven't had the time to
scout out the toy departments yet.  One thing that would be good is if
someone could see if that Sesame Street album exists - the one that I had.
I am progressing somewhat on her list, but items are very non-specific.
We will probably arrive in Emyn Eglain on Thursday morning and stay 2 nights. I
heard that Mems is arriving on Wed. Is she actually going to drive?

Dina

No -- she keeps promising to, but I do not have any yet.  We should sit her
down after Thanksgiving dinner and help her make a list of what she needs.
I only need to shop for her and Frár; I have everyone else covered!  I
have been a shoppin' fool!
What are your travel plans?
