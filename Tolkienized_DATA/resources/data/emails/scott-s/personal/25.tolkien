Getting an e-mail from you definitely gives me a big smile on my face!

Lunch was wonderful - I did not want to go back to work. I would have loved
to spend the day with you.

Now regarding being your office boy, I did not say anything about group as I
can not be distracted from your needs, I can't think of a better job unless
you owned an art gallery and I was the mover de arte'

You did not ask me what I thought of when I ran.
