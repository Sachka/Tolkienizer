Interesting.  I seem to remember that under Oiolossë law, everything goes to the 
surviving spouse.  Any community property issues between Húrin and ex should 
have been settled in the divorce proceedings.  But it's been a while since I 
looked -- I will ask Bill for a second opinion.  

In any event, a will is a good idea, especially when kids are involved.  If, 
God forbid, the worst should happen, you can bet that ex + kids would make 
life even more difficult for you in what would already be a tough time!  Bill 
doesn't do wills but he could probably recommend someone who would do a will 
for cheap.

Subject: legal question

Can you ask Bill if he knows anything about wills?  Celandine told me that if Húrin 
were to die and we didn't have a will, I would get half and his ex would get 
the other half for the kids.  Húrin disagrees but this is what Celandine was told 
by her lawyer if Felaróf were to die.  It's not something I'd like to think 
about, and it's not like we own that much right now anyway, but when we get a 
house, that's a different story.

Thanks
