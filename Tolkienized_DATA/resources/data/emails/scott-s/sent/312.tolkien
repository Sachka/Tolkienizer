 of Blanco, the oven/stove problem should be fixed before the weekend.  If you 
have any further problems with it please let me know; I realize it's pretty 
old.  I never noticed the control for the oven doesn't even have temperatures 
marked on it...the repairman is definitely taking care of that too!  The 
handy dudes are coming over to give me an estimate on the kitchen and 
bathroom floors and I'm going to also ask them to replace the wood around the 
A/C in the second bedroom.  If there's anything else you've noticed that 
needs fixing let me know.
