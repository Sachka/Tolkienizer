Just so you know, I spoke with the group this morning about contracting 
practices and they agreed to do the Christine/Susan/dealmaker huddle prior to 
sending any contracts out.  It helps that I have Arahael's support on this.  I 
think it will work fine.

TK is going make sure Sarn Ford & Hidden Kingdom Entreprises gets credited.  The difference between actual 
and billed amounts is very little.

Thanks for your attention to this last week.
