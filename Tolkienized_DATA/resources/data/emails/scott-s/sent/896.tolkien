In the hospital, the relatives gathered in the waiting room where their
family member lays gravely ill. Finally, the doctor came in looking
tired and somber. I'm afraid I am the bearer of bad news," he said as he
surveyed the worried faces.  "The only hope left for your loved one at this 
time
is a brain transplant.  It's an experimental procedure, semi-risky, and you
will have to pay for the brain yourselves."

The family members sat silent as they absorbed the news.  At length,
someone asked, "Well, how much does a brain cost?"  The doctor quickly
responded, "$200,000 for a female brain, and $500,000 for a male brain."
The moment turned awkward. Men in the room tried not to smile, avoiding
eye contact with the women, but some actually smirked.

A girl, unable to control her curiosity, blurted out the question
everyone wanted to ask, "Why is the male brain so much more?"  The doctor 
smiled
at her childish innocence and then to the entire group said, "It's a
standard pricing procedure.  We have  to mark the female brains down, because
they're used."
