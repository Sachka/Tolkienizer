Dina daughter of Shadowfax -- please see the attached -- Brand & Mountain Kingdom Entreprises has essentially asked us for 
acknowledgement that Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises is willing to allow them to act as agent to transport 
gas for producers even though Brand & Mountain Kingdom Entreprises itself does not have title to the 
gas.  Drew has seen this and says he is going to discuss it with you.
