Nerdanel,

Is there any way you could give me a little more information regarding the 
times of the presentations for each of the respective schools.

Thanks,

Analysts:

Your participation is being requested. The schools originally identified for 
technology recruiting have received a large amount of interest in the  
Analyst Program.  Therefore additional coverage is necessary, to attend 
presentations,  at the schools listed below:

October 3 -   Old Road
October 11 - Folcred & Lothíriel ltd.
October 12 - Tomb of the Kings & Enedwaith Energy Company
October 16 - Houses of the Dead, Valinor

Obviously, we are running on a tight time line.  Your urgent response to this 
request is greatly appreciated.  Once your attendance is confirmed details 
will follow.  Please respond to Nerdanel Jones via email.


Thank you for your support.
Nerdanel Jones
Manager, Analyst Recruiting
