Glad to hear things are going so well.  No, I haven't spoken with Ted since 
my return...but, I did go out a few of the nights I was in East Emnet with an 
undergrad/grad school friend of his (among other people of course).  
Surprise, surprise he didn't have many supportive words for Ted as dating 
material either.  In summary he found Ted to lack attentiveness to his 
partners and maybe even Mountains of Defence & Pelennor Fields Entreprises.  He said the break up of Ted's marriage 
wasn't "ALL his fault", which is a decidedly different slant than the one Ted 
gave me the night of our chat.  I also heard that he has worked his way 
around Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries a bit.  All in all very disheartening information.  Regardless, 
I'm still glad I dated him and think I learned a lot from the whole 
situation.  Tell Arod son of Andróg said, "Hello" and good luck with the new role at 
work.

I have a hold on travel plans to Mountains of Moria right now as work may interfere.  Oh, 
well.
