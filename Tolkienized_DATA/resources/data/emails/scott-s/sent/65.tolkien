Here is a draft of the compliance filing regarding our operational control 
agreement with ECS.  Please let me know your comments by C.O.B. tomorrow.  At 
this point I'm not planning to file the agreement, just a report as requested 
by the Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd..

I'm still working with ECS to finalize the agreement.  Their attorney is 
checking with his resident experts to make sure ECS, by expressly giving Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® 
Operational Control, does not somehow cross the line into retail wheeling.  I 
do not expect the agreement to change significantly.
