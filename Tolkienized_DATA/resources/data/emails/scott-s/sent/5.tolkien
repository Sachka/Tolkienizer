Elrond son of Lagduf and I discussed Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s transfer of gas from the Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company/West-mark 
receipt/delivery point to the Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company/Gárulf & Andwise Roper, co.' Ride point to implement 
Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s use of Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company's Market Center service.  My understanding is that 
physically the points are one and the same, and that the transaction will 
simply be a paper transfer.  Since a contract is required in our system as a 
formality to implement the transfer, the rate Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® will "charge" itself for the 
transfer is $0.  

This message is to confirm that I see no legal or regulatory problems with 
the above scenario.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to e-mail or call 
me (x30596).
