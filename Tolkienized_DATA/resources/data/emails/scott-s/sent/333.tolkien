I just received a copy of a Section 5 complaint filed by SoCal requesting a 
Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises order 1) determining that the SoCalGas/Topock delivery point is fully 
subscribed on a firm primary basis, 2) directing Rimmon to comply with 
previous Commission orders that preclude the selling of firm primary capacity 
at points where none is available and 3) directing Rimmon to schedule 
capacity acquired during an open season (effective Jan. 1, 2000) into 
SoCal/Topock on a secondary basis only.  SoCal states that it has experienced 
daily cuts of up to 57% and averaging 25%.

If you would like a copy of the complaint, let me know.
