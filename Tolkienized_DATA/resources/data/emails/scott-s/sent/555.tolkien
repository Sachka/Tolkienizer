Yes, the deal would have been for today.  I'm not sure who the trader was and 
Elrohir has already left for the day.  I will probably just leave a note for 
him with his packet and resolve the issue tomorrow.  

Thanks,

For today?  Also, do you know roughly what the of the deal is because I only 
see Borlad son of Gil-galad's and Arminas son of Elendur's deals
.
Today's deals do not contain any deals at Sumas with Elrohir son of Isilmë, again, I am 
speaking of Arminas son of Elendur and Borlad son of Gil-galad.
