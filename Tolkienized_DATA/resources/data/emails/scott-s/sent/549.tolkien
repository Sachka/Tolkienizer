Hi  of Éothain!

Your name has been mentioned for another UT recruiting opportunity.  Manwendil & Rivendell Energy Company 
Price and Eöl son of Baran are going up next week and would like to know can you 
accompany them.  Please give Manwendil & Rivendell Energy Company's assistant Ingwë son of Curufin a buzz @ 
36279 for the details.  Hope you can make it!

Thanks,
Olo
