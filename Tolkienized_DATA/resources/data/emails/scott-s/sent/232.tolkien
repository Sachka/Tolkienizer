So far I have not received comments from anyone on the attached.  
If you think it would be productive to get everyone together (possibly as 
early as Friday?) for about an hour to discuss capacity options, I will set 
up a meeting.   Please let me know one way or the other.
Thank you.

Subject: Capacity Options on Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on 
Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff 
language and a proposed form agreement.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the 
option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company 
should depart from existing policy and allow Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any 
other issues.  

I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming 
changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have 
resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.
