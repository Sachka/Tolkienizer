Okay, I'm dying to know...What was wrong with the car?  

Along those same lines, did you get them to bring the car to you here or do 
you have to go get it.  (Don't forget I need to get your parking pass to you.)

As for the home vs. theater viewing...I seem to be more of a home-body these 
days as well.

Hey,

My car actually works.  Can you believe it.  Now I can take you to movies and 
we can actually watch them but somehow I think watching a movie at home is 
just a tad more fun.

Evidently, in order for us to actually watch a movie we have to physically go 
to the theatre.  Somehow we keep missing that critical step in the home 
viewing experience...namely the viewing.
