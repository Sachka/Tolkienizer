Hey Malantur,

Just thought I'd let you know that Uldor son of Rudigar mentioned you by name in one 
of the Analyst/Associate  of Peregrin bag lunches.  He was talking about the Ag 
Trading initiative and who spear-headed the effort (I think the other guy he 
mentioned was Voronwë son of Rowan).  Anyway, thought you'd like to now you're 
definitely making a name for yourself around here.  Hope things are going 
well with you.

Talk to you soon,

 of Haldan
