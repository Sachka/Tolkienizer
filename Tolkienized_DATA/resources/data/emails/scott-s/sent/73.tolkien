I've gotten a bit more educated about IT revenue crediting since you asked 
your question yesterday.  "IT revenue crediting" is an industry term used to 
describe a requirement (brought about either by a Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises order or a rate case 
settlement) that IT revenues in excess of a certain dollar amount will be 
credited back to all firm shippers in the next rate proceeding or thru some 
refund mechanism.  Transwestern is currently not under any IT revenue 
crediting obligation, and I would be very hesitant to negotiate any such 
obligation with any individual shipper because then we would have to do the 
same for all firm shippers on a nondiscriminatory basis. 

If you need more info, let's talk.
