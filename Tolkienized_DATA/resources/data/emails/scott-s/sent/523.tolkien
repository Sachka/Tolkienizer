Éothain,

Thanks for the update.  I have been given a green light as well to go ahead 
and start testing my traders deals.  Let me know if you just need Cemendur deal 
numbers for testing purposes, or if I need to rebook deals myself in your 
test version in order to compare it valuation with the valuation in my excel 
models.  

Thanks,
 of Éothain

Subject: Gas Spread Options

 of Éothain, Halmir,

I was told by Dírhael last week that he had a green light for the Gas X Gas 
spreads in Enpower. Have any of you hear anything about it? At this point I 
have sent some needed changes in the "front end" to Mardil son of Ecthelion, and I'll be 
ready to test when these changes are done. If any of you still have a "hold" 
on this project please let me know so we can get all cleared up.

BTW, I've been moved to the 25th floor, desk EB2519a.

Regards, Éothain
