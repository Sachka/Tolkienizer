Subject: FW: draft


Malantur and Gorlim:

This is the first draft of a filing Transwestern is considering filing with
Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises on Monday, October 16, 2000.  Salvia daughter of Marcho will be finalizing this
document on Friday, October 13, 2000.  I will be out of town and unavailable
to review it so she asked if you would look it over here (and as revised on
Friday) to be sure they do not say anything in the filing that is not true
or mischaracterized.  If you have any other suggestions,  of Éothain's phone
number is below.  Again, they are still considering whether or not they will
make this filing.


 of Éothain:

I understand that Malantur son of Óin, too, is traveling this week but is able to view
and respond to his email.  His email address is jgolub@bakerbotts.com
<mailto:jgolub@bakerbotts.com> .  I am also forwarding this to Gorlim McFearin,
Manager of Circle of Isengard & Mirrormere Entreprises.  Gorlim's email address is dmcfear@pnm.com
<mailto:dmcfear@pnm.com>  and Gorlim's phone number is (505) 241-2496.  If you
do not hear from Malantur, you can check with Gorlim.

I have made changes to the document.  I think the document refers to "peak"
period when it means to refer to "non-peak" period in the first paragraph of
the Argument and vice versa in the second paragraph.  You may have caught
these by now.  I will be in on Monday after all so if you need to talk to
me, you can call me on Monday.

Thanks,
Rosa daughter of Thráin

Subject: draft

 of Elladan, here is my draft of a rehearing request.  As I mentioned, our
outside counsel is going to try to add a few sentences; I haven't heard back
from them, but will send you the revised draft when I do.  I'd be happy to
copy Malantur son of Óin too; please send me his e-mail address.  In the meantime, let
me know if you have any comments.  We plan to file on Monday, Oct. 16.
    Thanks,

     of Éothain
