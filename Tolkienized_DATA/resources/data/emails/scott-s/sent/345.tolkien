Subject: FW: draft


Voronwë and Togo:

This is the first draft of a filing Transwestern is considering filing with
Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company on Monday, October 16, 2000.  Berylla daughter of Folca will be finalizing this
document on Friday, October 13, 2000.  I will be out of town and unavailable
to review it so she asked if you would look it over here (and as revised on
Friday) to be sure they do not say anything in the filing that is not true
or mischaracterized.  If you have any other suggestions,  of Haldan's phone
number is below.  Again, they are still considering whether or not they will
make this filing.


 of Haldan:

I understand that Voronwë son of Falco, too, is traveling this week but is able to view
and respond to his email.  His email address is jgolub@bakerbotts.com
<mailto:jgolub@bakerbotts.com> .  I am also forwarding this to Togo McFearin,
Manager of Lefnui & Hirluin©.  Togo's email address is dmcfear@pnm.com
<mailto:dmcfear@pnm.com>  and Togo's phone number is (505) 241-2496.  If you
do not hear from Voronwë, you can check with Togo.

I have made changes to the document.  I think the document refers to "peak"
period when it means to refer to "non-peak" period in the first paragraph of
the Argument and vice versa in the second paragraph.  You may have caught
these by now.  I will be in on Monday after all so if you need to talk to
me, you can call me on Monday.

Thanks,
Lindissë daughter of Belegorn

Subject: draft

 of Belecthor, here is my draft of a rehearing request.  As I mentioned, our
outside counsel is going to try to add a few sentences; I haven't heard back
from them, but will send you the revised draft when I do.  I'd be happy to
copy Voronwë son of Falco too; please send me his e-mail address.  In the meantime, let
me know if you have any comments.  We plan to file on Monday, Oct. 16.
    Thanks,

     of Haldan
