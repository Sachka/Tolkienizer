Just to forewarn you two, it looks like Beregar (Ted's buddy) is going to be 
in East Emnet for a few months working on a project.  When I mentioned you two 
were both over there right now he asked me for your email addresses.  No 
pressure for you guys to do anything with him, but I do like the guy and 
think when I come over we will definitely have to do something with him (and 
Khîm son of Herubrand of course...maybe the same night, that whole "kill two birds with 
one stone concept").

Side-note:  I'm am dying of curiosity as to why Beregar is going to East Emnet for 
a project and Ted is trading corn here.  Maybe I'll find out before Beregar 
leaves.  
       Who knows, maybe if you all see Beregar over there you can find out 
what the heck happened with our once so promising Grimbeorn son of Telemnar.
