 of Tuor, you have no idea how appropriate that email was for me this morning.  I 
spent much of this weekend thinking the exact same thing.  I'm pretty sure 
the Monte concert is on a Saturday night, but I'll have to double check on 
that.  I got to see Fingon son of Boron Goes to Ford of Stones this weekend on the big 
screen at the old River Oaks Theater, it was wonderful.  And, Shelob,  of Arod and 
myself went to Tin Hall Saturday night to see Adalgar son of Telchar.  We met 
the three cutest, Outer Dark & Déagol Entreprises there.  It renewed my faith in the 
opposite sex.
