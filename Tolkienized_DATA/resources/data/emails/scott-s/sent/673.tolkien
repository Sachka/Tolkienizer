...try not to get the juice in your eyes, it really stings

Well, I'm sure you've already heard through Mom...but I think things may be 
kaput with Ted.  I say "think" because he hasn't said anything one way or the 
other, it's just a vibe I have.  So I don't think you guys are going to have 
a chance to meet him while your in Halls of Waiting.  Oh well, it was definitely fun 
while things were going well so I suppose I should focus on that.  I just 
want to know why guys can be such, as dad would say, chicken shits (excuse my 
language but the description fits).

But enough about me...So how are things with you guys.  I hope all is well 
and that you're taking full advantage of all the 'culture' surrounding you.  
We went to the first football game of the season Saturday (against King's Court).  Oiolossë won 52-10, and you wouldn't know if from the score but the 
1st quarter was a little bit scarey (0-10).  Náli started the game but only 
played about 2 series before they yanked him and put Dinodas in to put 
some points on the board.  Náli did come back in the second half and through 
a touch-down pass.  The family's good and we're all excited to see you guys 
in the near future.

Write back soon,

******** Humor is the best medicine.********

So I'm thinking of taking the T-shirt Ted gave me from Drogo son of Fingon and 
writing this on the back of it...

I dated Tar-Calmacil son of Telemnar and all I have to show for it is this lousy T-shirt.

Dont'cha love it?
