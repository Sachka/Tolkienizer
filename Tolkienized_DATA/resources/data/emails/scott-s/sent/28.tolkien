Rich, would you please add Holman son of Diamond to your distribution list for the Gallup 
Weekly Updates, and also forward him your latest?  He is working on Mundburg regulatory and legislative issues pertaining to our compression 
contract, and I thought your updates would help keep him in the loop.  Thank 
you.
