This would be analogous to every time you send me an e-mail, I forward it 
directly to Drew and  of Lorgan.  How do you tactfully advise your coworkers about 
corporate etiquette?  I wonder.
On a substantive note, I sincerely believe the analysis MKM wants is beyond 
the scope of this letter, and would have no qualms about sending it.

Now do you see why I didn't want to send this to  of Belba Petersen???  Anytime 
you send anything to Amon Rûdh, the MKM cult goes into their Satan worship 
chamber, they sing a few chants, and then sacrifice the good commercial 
effort to the demon regulatory god.  

Jeez, next time I'm gonna just send it out to the customer and ask for 
forgiveness later.

Jeff,  do you have the information for the rate?  We would have to file a 
certificate and the rate would need to be calculated in accordance with the 
Ened & Éothain, co.-  I want to make sure that the rate you are planning 
to quote matches what the rate derivation for the filing would be-  avoid a 
potential issue-  maybe  of Pallando could send us what he did- thanks  MK

Subject: Proposal to Radbug & Astulat Entreprises

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Withered Heath & Western Mountains Entreprises for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Halfred project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Withered Heath & Western Mountains Entreprises' 
consultant, ThéodenTherindë, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, Hamson son of Edrahil calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.
