Hey there yourself,

Sorry I haven't written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated.  I 
am indeed checking on flights to Númendor and don't think I'm going to go at 
exactly the same time as my parents.  As much fun as they are, I figured we 
would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them.

As for Ted, things are still going well although I haven't see him at all 
this week (we are two very busy people).  But, we had a great laid back day 
last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage...you know, not 
quite so formal about dates etc.  In one sense it's great, but it also makes 
things a lot harder to read.  Anyway, I'm sure my Mom told you guys but 
Bracegirdle and Pimpernel daughter of Felaróf to meet him and I think it went well.  Hopefully, if 
we're still dating come December, you and Isengar can meet him when you come 
back to visit.  I'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the Doors of Felagund 
games, I just have to find out when he wants to go (as well as properly 
prepare him for the Scott/Kelley/Parks/Wild Card gang and the full-day affair 
that is a Doors of Felagund game).

Things in Halls of Waiting are good and definitely warm.  I went with Emily and her 
Mom last night to see the musical "Rent" and it was wonderful.  Also, I'm 
going out to Causeway, in Gondor for the Labor Day weekend to visit Hoot's daughter 
 of Gróin.  Needless to say I am very excited.

Talk to you  guys soon,
Smaug & Tol Falas©.

Hey girlie,

How are you doing?  Haven't heard from you in a while.
 A little birdie told me that you were checking into
tickets for Númendor.  Are you really?  Would you come
with your parents or separately?  In any case, we have
had some more time to do some exploring (and
shopping), so we have some good ideas about what to do
if you come.  I think that we will stay in Mountains of Moria when
your parents come and do the whole base thing (which
will take only a few minutes, actually), but are
considering going to Longbottom or somewhere during part of
Thanksgiving.  We'll do whatever you want want if you
still are coming!

Let us know the latest with Ted and also with what's
going on in Halls of Waiting.

Take care,
Anárion
