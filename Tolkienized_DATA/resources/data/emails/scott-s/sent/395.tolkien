First of all, this is a brand-new contract, not a modification of one that 
used to be IT.
It's for LFT space that we have posted according to our usual procedure.  A 
receipt point has now been specified:  Desert of Lostladen & Bregolas© Compressor.  Our tariff 
allows us to cancel LFT up to 10 days a month, but it also provides that the 
parties can agree that the number of days can be fewer, so Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd. negotiated 
us down to only one day.  TK worked with Narmacil son of Artamir on this and they 
determined this would be acceptable from an operational standpoint.  
Scheduling will happen pursuant to the LFT priority set forth in our tariff.
I left a message for you just now; call when you have a minute.

 of Haldan, MKM's got some good questions about this.  I'm still nervous as a cat 
about the deals, so please give me a call Mon. AM and let me know what you 
know about the scheduling priority and how it has changed now that this is an 
LFT deal.  DF

We really do need to understand the scheduling of this,  if alternates 
haven't been scheduled, IT are and now an LFT---  seems a little 
questionable, so we need to understand the answer.  Also without knowing the 
receipt point how do we know the deal can be done as LFT??  MK
