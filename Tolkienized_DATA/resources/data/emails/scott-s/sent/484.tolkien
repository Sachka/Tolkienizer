Okay...My itinerary is as follows:  Arriving in Causeway, in Gondor 2:20 am Friday 
night (I'll need your new address for the cab) and departing Sunday at 6:15 
pm.  If you just want to leave the key under the mat that would be perfect 
for me...I'll probably crash immediately anyway.  I am so excited to be 
coming out there - -  I really need a break from Halls of Waiting...not to mention 
work.  The Gas Lamp district Saturday night sounds like fun and I would love 
to meet your friends.  Also, please don't feel like you have to plan the 
whole weekend, I have no problem going with the flow.  

See you in a couple of weeks,
 of Haldan
