I am somewhat frightened that you would allow yourself to be referred to as 
MaximMan.  While I realize you are a fan of the magazine, professing so too 
loudly may hinder your efforts with the ladies (some of us do have a shread 
of dignity, which that periodical in particular attempts to tear away).  My 
advice is keep it in the closet or bathroom or where ever it comes in most 
"handy".
