TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY


Please review the attached non-standard discount letter for Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd. Energy 
Trading Corporation.  Pursuant to Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd.'s Gallup Expansion Agreement 
allowing Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd. the right to "call" upon SoCalNeedles capacity, subject to 
availability, at a $.30 rate,  Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd. has requested to obtain 23,000 Dth/d of 
East of Thoreau (EOT) to SoCalNeedles capacity for the July - October term.  
Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd.'s blended rate of $.2928 represents 21,500 Dth/d of capacity at 
$.30/Dth (their "call" capacity) and 1,500 Dth/d of additional Needles 
capacity sold to them at $.19/Dth.

Non-standard provisions contained in Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd.'s original Gallup expansion 
Agreement  are included in the discount letter and contained in Paragraphs 3 
and 4:

 Palisor & Aravorn Entreprises 3 grants Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd. the ability to have alternate delivery points in 
Transwestern's EOT Area at the discounted rate in situations where Amdír & Hundar Energy Company' 
"window"  can be shown to reduce Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd.'s nominated deliveries to Amdír & Hundar Energy Company.  
Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd. must provide Transwestern a written confirmation from Amdír & Hundar Energy Company 
indicating a reduction in scheduled volumes in order to obtain such alternate 
delivery capacity at the discounted rate.  If written confirmation is either 
not provided or Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd. elects to transport on an alternate basis to the EOT 
Area due to favorable market conditions, then the rate for such transport 
shall be the discounted rate plus $.01.

Palisor & Aravorn Entreprises 4 grants Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd. the ability during the term of the July - October 
transportation agreement, to move their primary delivery point from 
SoCalNeedles to Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company/West-mark, Mojave /West-mark, or to the potential SWG 
interconnect subject to capacity availability and a 5 day notification 
period.  Great Middle Haven & Amon Amarth ltd. may also have the ability to return to the SoCalNeedles 
delivery during this term subject to the described conditions as well.
