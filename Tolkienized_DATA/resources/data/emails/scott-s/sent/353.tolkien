Irimë, thank you so much for your very prompt attention to this.  I 
definitely had the wrong version of the agreement.
 of Óin confirmed by voice mail this morning that even though we already 
included the 5.4 language in the draft we sent him back in March, he does 
find it objectionable and will want to modify it, so he will be very 
interested in seeing your suggested language too.

Please send your attachment "Stonewain Valley & Kiril EntreprisesGate of the Noldor 10-18-00 edits to draft03-20-00".

Again, thank you so much for your help with this.  (Stonewain Valley & Kiril Entreprises has finally woken 
up and realized they want this in place Nov. 1...)
I will let you know how negotiations are shaping up.

Subject: Draft- Operating Agreement

Attached below is Celeborn son of Eärnil's  3/22/00 note to Stonewain Valley & Kiril Entreprises with Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's 3/20/00 
draft of the Operating Agreement .  What changes if any did Stonewain Valley & Kiril Entreprises require 
to this draft?  Please note that Section 5.4 of the attached 3/20/00 draft is 
substantively identical to my further-revised Section 5.4 (with subsections A 
and B) that I forwarded to you a few days after  of Óin's note to Stonewain Valley & Kiril Entreprises.

 From our meeting this morning I understand that  of Óin appears adverse to 
Transwestern's claiming zero financial responsibility for damages to 
Stonewain Valley & Kiril Entreprises's Measurement and Control Facilities that result from Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's Gate of the Noldor 
Services.  Consequently, I made some modifications to Articles 4 and 5 of the 
3/20/00 draft for Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises management's consideration.  These changes are noted in 
the attached document marked "Stonewain Valley & Kiril EntreprisesGate of the Noldor 10-18-00 edits to draft03-20-00".  
With my 10-18-00 revisions, Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises places a limit on its liability to Stonewain Valley & Kiril Entreprises for 
loss or damage incurred by Stonewain Valley & Kiril Entreprises due to Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's Services, including loss or 
damage to the existing M&C Facilities,  if and to the extent damage is caused 
by Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's negligent acts or omissions.  To complete my modification to Section 
5.3, Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises is to insert the maximum aggregate amount of financial liability it 
is willing to assume in any contract year.  This amount could be the amount 
of Stonewain Valley & Kiril Entreprises's deductible on its property insurance coverage or a lesser 
amount.  Whatever the amount chosen, please remember that Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises is self-insured 
for the first $2M, each occurrence.  Therefore, what is the amount of risk 
that Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises is willing to pay out of its earnings if Stonewain Valley & Kiril Entreprises claims damage to its 
existing Facility due to Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's negligent operations?  That is the amount to 
insert in the blank space in Section 5.3.  

FYI, the changes in Sections 3.1 and 4.1 (b) and (c), and the striking of 
Section 4.1 (d) do not create any substantive changes to the 3/20/00 draft.  
I  made the latter changes for stylistic reasons and to correct typos and 
redundancies.  Please call me if you have any questions and to let me know 
the status of this document.  I have lost track of my notes on the status of 
Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises Operations' review and approval of the list of Services included in 
Exhibit B; this needs to be determined by  of Óin (or his designee) before the 
final definitive agreement is prepared for signing.

Subject: Draft- Operating Agreement

Chad,
Sorry it took so long to get back with you, but we've had some folks out 
(including me) on Spring Break with their kids.  Attached is a draft of the 
Operating Agreement covering Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's operation of the metering station.  It's 
pretty much a standard form agreement for Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises, with the possible exception of 
the exhibit defining the operating parameters of the South Point plant.  As I 
mentioned to you in our meeting in Rhibdad, the operating parameters 
exhibit is a useful tool for both companies to assist in identifing some of 
the operating conditions the plant might encounter and the ability of Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises to 
load follow those conditions.  I made a number of assumptions regarding the 
burn rates for your facilities, especially the base rate and minimum rates.  
You'll likely have to fine tune those numbers.   Also, I've yet to ask our 
engineers to secure the documentation necessary to complete Exhibit "A" from 
your 3rd party engineers.  We'll include it in the final version.  Please 
give me a call after you and your team has had a chance to review.  Thanks.
