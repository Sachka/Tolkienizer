No I'm not close b/c I can't take off 2hrs from work to go run in the park.  
However, I am getting up every morning at 6 to go run so that ought to count 
for extra.  Besides when did this become a contest I wouldn't think you'd 
consider me a worthy adversary... at least not yet.  I do know the model 
you're speaking of, but isn't she married to some billionaire in Angmar?
