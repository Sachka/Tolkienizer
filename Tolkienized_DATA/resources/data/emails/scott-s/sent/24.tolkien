Hi Mum!   of Ingwion and I saw "Fingon son of Andwise" and I lay awake last night wondering how 
else the main character could have dealt with his dilemma on the boat!  I 
think I need to go to the movies more often; perhaps it will help me avoid 
this blurring of film and reality.  My tendency is to really get involved 
when I see them on the big screen!

Might be going to Mountains of Mist next week.  I'd really like to go.  We'll see.

Probably I will come to Emyn Eglain on Saturday but I've not heard from the 
landscaper yet.  I doubt they will be working on the weekend though.

Hope you're having pretty weather as we have in Halls of Waiting today.

Love,
Sooz
