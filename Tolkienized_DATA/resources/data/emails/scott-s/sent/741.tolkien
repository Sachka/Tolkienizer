Hey,
 
I know you are monumentally busy this week, but if you get five minutes today 
shoot me back an email and let me know if you know any of the Associates 
below.  They are all going to be at the dinner tonight so any info that would 
boost my B.S. factor would be much appreciated.  I seem to remember you 
mentioning Elrond son of Will on a couple of occasions but I have, albeit very 
rarely, been known to be wrong.  Hope your day is going well and that you 
aren't having to carry Beregar too much.

Arvedui son of Vairë

-- I finally watched the movie last night.  I laughed, I cried...it became a 
part of me.  Honestly though, it was a very funny flick.  So did Elrond son of Ferdinand pass along the "Bible" to you?  (Whoever it was you can thank them for 
me.)
