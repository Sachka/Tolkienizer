 of Óin, this morning I spoke with Reliant's regulatory counsel, who called me 
after talking with Huor son of Finrod, and who seemed eager to look into drafting a 
filing.  I would be happy to talk with GerontiusBrownlock or June Suwara at 
Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd. about doing the same, but somehow think Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd. might be a tougher 
customer (don't know why I would think that...).  My suggestion is that we 
work through Drogo son of Grithnir initially.  Anticipating that we might encounter some 
inertia at Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd.'s regulatory dept. -- and to give you an outline to work 
from when talking to Lindissë -- I put together the attached rough draft of a 
motion to intervene and motion to expedite to be filed by Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd..  

Feel free to send the attached to Lindissë.  However, please do so with the 
caveat that you are sending it for discussion purposes only, not as legal 
advice to Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd. from ET&S's legal department, and the content of this 
pleading should ultimately be up to Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd.'s legal/regulatory staff.

Reliant's counsel said he'd be sending me a draft of his pleading...if I 
don't hear from him within a reasonable time I'll call to follow up.
