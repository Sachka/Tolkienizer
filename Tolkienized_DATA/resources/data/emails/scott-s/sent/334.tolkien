Yes and Yes.  I'd like our Halls of Waiting lawyers to attend the Halls of Waiting presentation 
and if you can do one up here, I'd like our Amon Rûdh lawyers to attend also.  
Thanks.  DF

Subject: Fragrant Trees & River Harner© Presentation

For the past two months I have been visiting the Mountain of Fire & Berilac Brandybuck Entreprises Operations Regional 
offices giving a presentation on physical "Fragrant Trees & River Harner© Fundamentals and Issues" .

The presentation has been very well received.  Interest is high, and numerous 
questions have been raised at each meeting.  The presentation can be given in 
50 minutes if questions are limited.  It has taken up to 3 hours due to the 
amount of questions from the attendees. 

One  focus of these meetings is to give the field staff a better 
understanding of the impact  Fragrant Trees & River Harner© has on our bottom line (TW) and  the impact 
it has on our shipper costs (NNG). 

Yesterday, 10/4/00 I had the opportunity to meet with several members of the 
financial group in Halls of Waiting to discuss Fragrant Trees & River Harner©.  Coming out of that meeting was a 
request to schedule a Halls of Waiting presentation on "Fragrant Trees & River Harner© Fundamentals".  This has 
been done, and will be at 1 PM on Oct. 18, 2000. (Place yet to be determined.)

Two Questions:

Is there any interest in having me give the presentation in Amon Rûdh?????
Do you have any staff in Halls of Waiting that you would like  to invite to the 10/18 
presentation????


Copy of the presentation if you are interested:     

Thanks  Amroth  37885
