Part of me is tempted to do the "taste of your own medicine" thing, but I was 
really disappointed that he took that approach (in this case I think email is 
very cowardly) and don't believe two wrongs make a right.  I insist on taking 
the high road in this situation no matter how tempting it might be to teach 
him a lesson.
