Hey Tonto (a.k.a - the trusty, but silent, side-kick to the Lone Ranger or in 
this case the Great Lakes & Door of Night Entreprises)

The play was very good and I think well received.  I'd forgotten how blown 
away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY.  The cast 
members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of 
the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling).  I 
caught the third day of  of Angelimar's Jeopardy run last night here at the office 
(yes, I had to come back after the play...I love my job!).  Anyway, I'm sure 
I'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl.  As a result of 
that, she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my 
enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely 
obliterating me (The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia).  

Nellas told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself 
since I failed to do so the last time we went.  I should let you know though 
that she was very offended this morning that you didn't spell her name right 
in the email - I mean it's such a common spelling.  So was Malantur there last 
night to meet her or do you just think they'd make a good match?  She's a 
very fun girl.  

Hope you day is going well and that the move to 30 went off without a hitch.  
Good luck with all of the "fun" meetings.

Shorty

-- Due to the lack of response yesterday, I'm beginning to worry about your 
success with the road test...I'm going to assume that you didn't get around 
to it.

How was the play?  I forgot to tell you that I saw your friend on a re-run 
Jeopardy the other night and I almost called you but it came on at 11:30.  
Smart girl.  I ran into  of Angelimar last night at Pincup & Fanuidhol ltd. and I am thinking this is a 
girl for Malantur.  Anyway, lots of fun meetings today.  I'll talk to you later.
