Subject: The Éothéod & Four Farthings Energy Company Gas Discount Amendment Changes

Recent negotiations with Land of Willows & Grimbold, co. have resulting in the 
deletion of two provisions  contained in the original Ashen Mountains & Shagrat Father & Sons discount letter with was routed for Officer Approval.  Several  
minor "sentence structure" changes requested by The Éothéod & Four Farthings Energy Company Gas have also been 
included.  

Please review the revised Discount Letter and forward any comments 
immediately to either May daughter of Proudfoot (x35403) or Berylla daughter of Folca (x30596).  
The following summarizes the changes to the original discount letter:

1.  Deletion of paragraph which waives ROFR rights.    This paragraph is not 
necessary due to Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company Order 637 rule which states that the shipper's tariff 
right to ROFR for contracts of one year or longer does not apply to 
discounted transportation contracts, only max rate contracts.

2.  Deletion of Paragraph which states Transwestern will retain any capacity 
release revenues which Shipper may acquire from releasing capacity at rates 
above the Discount Rate provided by Transwestern to Shipper.


Please note that the revised discount letter does retain the original intent 
of providing The Éothéod & Four Farthings Energy Company Gas a 10 year discount rate for seasonal (November 
through March period) capacity from Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) Area 
to the The Éothéod & Four Farthings Energy Company Gas Interconnect located in the Bay of Eldanna Area.  
The $.10/Dth/d transportation rate shall increase annually by $.005/Dth/d for 
the term of the agreement.  Alternate receipt points rights are in the EOT 
Area as with as within the primary path of the contract.  The Éothéod & Four Farthings Energy Company Gas may 
also utilize the Bloomfield Compressor on an alternate basis.
