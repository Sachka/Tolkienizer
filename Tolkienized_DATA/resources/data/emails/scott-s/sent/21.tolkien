I'm attaching an article that I just received about the Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd.'s and Indicated 
Shippers' protests of the recent Onodló & Gamling Father & Sons deal on Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises.   I have a call in to 
Bombur son of Vëantur to talk about formulating a formal response, and I will keep you 
in that loop in case you get any inquiries.  (My initial, unofficial reaction 
is that with the marketing affiliate rules and other safeguards in place, the 
fact that Onodló & Gamling Father & Sons and Transwestern have the same parent company should make no 
difference to the Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company.)  Until further notice, I would avoid any 
communication with Onodló & Gamling Father & Sons on these issues.  If you have any questions, please 
e-mail or call me (x30596).

Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.-Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises Deal Could Mute Competition to CA

     Fearing an end to pipeline competition in Sunlands, the state's 
regulators and Indicated
     Shippers have called on Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company to summarily reject the three 
transportation agreements by
     which Sackville-Baggins & Beleriand Father & Sons has contracted for 1.25 Bcf/d of 
unsubscribed firm
     capacity on Kingsland  & Halfred Greenhand Father & Sons. 

     Approval of these agreements would give Northfarthing of the Shire & Filibert Bolger Father & Sons, parent of 
Transwestern Pipeline
     and Kingsland  & Forest of Fangorn©, control over all the available transportation 
capacity to the
     southern Sunlands border, warned Tar-Ciryatan son of Hobson, principal attorney for 
the Sunlands
     Public Utilities Commission (Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd.), which plans to submit its protest 
today. Between
     the two pipelines, he estimated Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm 
capacity from the
     Void and Hill of Oromet basins to Sunlands. 

     For  of Hobson, Kingsland  & Forest of Fangorn©'s contracting of the Imloth Melui & Deeping-stream Father & Sons 
represents a
     worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company Marketing and 
Trade, who has
     held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31. 
"At least then
     there was some Transwestern competition to the Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company situation. Now 
it's Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd., the
     owner of Transwestern, who's stepping into Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company's shoes." 

     But "what's even worse," he told Cabed-en-Aras & Way of Running Waters Services, is the revenue-sharing provision 
in the contracts. It
     stipulates that "after Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. makes $35 million off of these contracts, 
it has to share the
     proceeds with Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises for 25% of anything beyond $35 million. So 
effectively, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. and
     Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises have become partners in how high they can jack up the 
transportation rate
     differential between the Sunlands border and the The Éothéod & Four Farthings Energy Company producing 
basins." 

     The two pipeline companies "that have for decades competed with each 
other in carrying
     The Éothéod & Four Farthings Energy Company supplies to Sunlands are now partners. We think that's 
anticompetitive, and
     there's no way Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company should approve it,"  of Hobson said. He recalled the 
basis differential
     between the Starwards spot price and the Sunlands border shot up 
by 17% during
     1998, the first year during which Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company controlled the Imloth Melui & Deeping-stream Father & Sons 
into Sunlands.
     This situation could worsen under Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd., he believes. 

     "At first blush the Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises-Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. contracts [do] not appear to contain 
the same
     anticompetitive features of the Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises-Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company contracts," Indicated 
Shippers noted, but
     a "closer review and analysis" reveals the anticompetitive effects of 
the revenue-sharing
     provision (Glóin & Sauron's Road Energy Company) in Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises-Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. contracts "are not only similar" to 
those of the hotly
     contested reservation-reduction mechanism (RRM) in the Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises-Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company 
case, "but are
     increased......due to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing 
affiliate of Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises's
     primary interstate pipeline competitor," Transwestern. 

     Both the RRM and Glóin & Sauron's Road Energy Company "operate to provide a disincentive for Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises and 
its competitors
     to compete against each other, or to take any other action that will act 
to drive down the
     basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity," 
Indicated Shippers told
     Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company in a protest filed on Wednesday [RP97-287-041]. The group includes 
producers
     Falls & Oatbarton© Production, Forest of Region Resources Oil and Gas, Marathon Oil, and 
Frogmorton & South Road of Gondor®, and two marketers - Falls & Oatbarton© Energy Trading and  of Bregolas Gas 
Marketing. 

     Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company "should reject the tariff filing immediately. The Commission erred 
in allowing the
     Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises-Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company contracts to remain intact for their two-year term after 
finding that the
     contracts were anticompetitive. This issue is pending in the [Bywater Pool & Calmindon Services].
     That same error should not be repeated here," the producers and 
marketers said. 

     The Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd.'s attempt to block the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.-Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises contracts at the outset is 
a little bit
     unusual for the agency,  of Hobson said, but it learned its lesson following 
Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company. "When the
     Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company situation first hit, we asked for Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company to investigate the matter. 
We thought
     Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company did a very inadequate job then.....This time around we're asking 
for Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company to
     summarily reject it. It's hard for an agency like ours to take such a 
strong stand right at
     the beginning, but we've learned too much from two years of suffering 
under the Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company
     situation. And this is even worse." 

     In the event the Commission should reject Sunlands's request, the Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. 
has asked that
     an "anti-hoarding condition" be included in the contracts, which would 
require Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. to
     release unused capacity into the short-term market at a price higher 
than what it's paying
     Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises for the capacity. "They must make a little profit,"  of Hobson 
noted. "We're confident
     Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. can't use the entire 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity.....so there's going to 
be unused
     capacity." 

     The agency also wants Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company to clarify that the primary delivery point 
for the Block II
     portion of the capacity (579MMcf/d) is Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda©-West-mark in keeping with the 
terms of the
     1996 settlement between Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises and its customers.  of Hobson said he agreed 
fully with
     Falls & Oatbarton©, Forest of Region Resources and Southern Sunlands Gas (House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons), 
which accused
     Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises of violating the 1996 agreement by allowing Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company to use 
House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons-West-mark as
     a primary delivery point for the Block II capacity last summer. They 
contend the alleged
     violation is included in the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. contracts. 

     He also noted the Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. will challenge the ability of Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. to call back 
Block II capacity
     after it already had been recalled by River Rivil & Tyrn Gorthad® to serve Lake Evendim 
Gas and Loudwaterectric
     (Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda©) customers in Framsburg. Last July, Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company granted Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company 
the right to
     do this under its contracts with Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises. But  of Hobson contends the 
decision violates the
     1996 settlement under which Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda© paid $54 million to preserve the right 
of the pipeline's
     shippers to recall the Block II capacity to serve end-users in its 
service territory. 

     The Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. also intends to challenge the Commission's decision that would 
enable Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.
     to "just sit on the capacity," thereby withholding idle Block II 
capacity from the market.
     Indicated Shippers also contend the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. contracts violate the Block II 
capacity
     provisions of the 1996 rate case, as well as "exacerbate" the primary 
firm delivery point
     capacity-allocation issues that are pending before Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company now. 

     The Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. accused Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises of "deliberately" filing the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. contracts at 
Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company just
     before the holidays to avoid controversy. The pipeline "is trying to 
sneak one of the most
     controversial things ever past Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company right before Borladtmas so that 
protests would be
     minimized," said  of Hobson. "They did this with the Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company contracts two 
years ago. They
     have a pattern of filing right at the last minute, making it harder for 
people to protest and
     harder for Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company to stop it from going into effect."
