 of Blanco,

I am so sorry we never managed to meet up while I was in East Emnet.  Emily and I 
spent all day Sunday gallivanting around the city to the markets, etc. and 
Monday I ended-up spending a lot longer than I planned at the office.  On the 
bright side, I was able to have an impromptu interview and meet quite a few 
people while I was there.  I'm hoping to be over there and gainfully employed 
by early next spring.  Hope things are well with you and the next trip I make 
over there we will definitely get together.

 of Haldan
