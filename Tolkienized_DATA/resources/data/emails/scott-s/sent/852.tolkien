So Fredegar hits me with "I hear you drink like a fish.  Supposedly you were 
slamming them back last night."  When I asked where he garnered such 
information he told me "From our friend on 28."  I promptly sent the 
following message "Nice...so do you inform everyone you come in contact with 
that I drink like a fish?"  Result, no response to me but he called Fredegar to 
lambast him for ratting him out.  And the eternal question remains, if no 
longer interested why care so much?
