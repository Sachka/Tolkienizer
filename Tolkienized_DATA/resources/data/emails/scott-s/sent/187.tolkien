On Friday the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises issued an order suspending (until October 15, 2000) 
Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's tariff sheets for acquiring Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises capacity, and calling for a technical 
conference.  The Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises stated that while Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's proposal may be in the 
public interest, further investigation of the issues, including those raised 
by Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company in its protest, is necessary prior to authorization.  The order 
does not make clear what issues are to be investigated, but they seem to 
include:  whether Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises will, in effect, become a marketer for Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises's services, 
whether the rates are just and reasonable and whether there is any expansion 
of monopoly power.  Additionally, the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises noted that while Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises has 
certificate (i.e., Brockenbores & Mansion of the Khazâd, co.) authority to transport gas 
in interstate commerce, Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises will "have to either explain how it has 
appropriate rate authority for transportation of natural gas in interstate 
commerce, or seek appropriate rate authority from the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises."    of Tarondor 
has forwarded a copy of the order to Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises so that they can begin taking the 
appropriate steps.

I will talk with regulatory about technical conference dates and will tell 
you when I have further information.  If you would like a copy of the order, 
let me know.
