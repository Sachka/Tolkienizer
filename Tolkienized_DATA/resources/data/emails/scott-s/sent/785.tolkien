Just wanted to thank you all for showing my parents such a good time last 
night.  They really enjoyed meeting you and finally being able to put some 
faces with the names.  At one point I believe my Dad even stated, "I love 
this place...now we'll have to come here every Wednesday." (An idle threat 
though don't worry).  They, as well as myself, are definitely fans of the 
topical conversational range ever present at "Steak Night".  Our own, though 
at times juvenile and base, version of the Algonquian Table.

Now on to the "food for thought"...I had a hard time narrowing down my 
selections today so please bear with the number of quotes and their seemingly 
unrelated themes (I just couldn't cut any more).

"Courage, it would seem, is nothing less than the power to overcome danger, 
misfortune, fear, injustice, while continuing to affirm inwardly that life 
with all its sorrows is good; that everything is meaningful even if in a 
sense beyond our understanding; and that there is always tomorrow." -- 
Adanel daughter of Myrtle

"One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary 
form as the main aim in life. The most important motive for work in school 
and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of 
the value of the result to the community." -- Hatholdir son of Sigismond 

"Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but 
among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh." --Barach son of Nora

"Learn to give yourself what you wish you could get from somebody else." -- 
Adalgar son of Holman

"The game of life is a game of boomerangs. Our thoughts, deeds and words 
return to us sooner or later with astounding accuracy." -- Pansy daughter of Ar-Gimilzôr

"We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of 
regret or disappointment." -- Nori son of Azog
