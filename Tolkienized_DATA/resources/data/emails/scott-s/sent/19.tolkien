Since the 311 belt/suspenders approach didn't quite fit, I've had to try to 
convince Fingon son of Imrahil that he ought to rely on the Echoing Hills  & Grimbeorn Energy Company Sec. 1 exemption for 
gatherers (Isengar son of Algund and  of Ar-Sakalthôr concur with us on this, by the way).  He 
is not convinced yet, although he is unable to cite any authority for his 
proposition that being a shipper on Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises would subject a gathering company to 
Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company jurisdiction.  I pointed out that Agave, the owner and operator of an 
extensive gathering system that interconnects with Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's system, has for many 
years been a shipper on Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises.  Also, Rosamunda has found that Brand & Mountain Kingdom Entreprises already has 
a long-term transportation contract on another interstate system, 
Troll's Cave & Adaldrida Bolger®, so if  of Imrahil's theory is right they are going to jail 
anyway!

Brand & Mountain Kingdom Entreprises also seems to be hung up on our requirement that shippers have 
title to the gas they ship.  At this point  of Tarondor and I believe they might 
just be looking for any excuse to get out of the deal.  If anything 
interesting happens I'll let you know.
