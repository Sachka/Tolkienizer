Almiel -- FYI, here is my draft of the fuel filing for Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®.  This is very much a 
work in progress and we're having a meeting tomorrow to discuss logistics.  
We've invited Fëanor and  of Orodreth to the meeting; if there is anyone else you 
think we should include just let me know.
