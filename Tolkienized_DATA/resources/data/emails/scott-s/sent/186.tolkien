Lily -- FYI, here is my draft of the fuel filing for Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises.  This is very much a 
work in progress and we're having a meeting tomorrow to discuss logistics.  
We've invited Narmacil and  of Marcho to the meeting; if there is anyone else you 
think we should include just let me know.
