Findis,

I am indeed the right person and will be happy to rebook the deals below.  
Just so you know, there are going to be several more deals that will need to 
be rebooked as soon as the Doors of Angband & Hidden City Deliveries's are set up.  If you could just let me know 
when the new Doors of Angband & Hidden City Deliveries's are set-up I will rebook the other deals as well.

Thanks,

Findis,

Have you tried Salvia daughter of Marcho?  She is the Book Admin that entered these and 
she's usually very helpful.  If you can't get in touch with her, let me know 
and I'll go up and see if I can get someone on that desk to move these over.

Thanks,
Goodenough

Goodenough,

 I have been trying to get these deals rebooked and can't seem to find the 
right person.  The Doors of Angband & Hidden City Deliveries's have been set up and the deals just need to be 
moved.  Please let me know who I need to send these to if you can't help.
