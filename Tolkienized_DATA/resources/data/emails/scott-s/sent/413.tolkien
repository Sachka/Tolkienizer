I am not sure about Linda daughter of Axantur but maybe Drew or Berylla daughter of Folca know. I do 
not get reports from anyone else regarding activities in any state.

Steve - is Linda daughter of Findis(sp?) an Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. employee?   I know she once was, but I 
believe she lives in Stock Road and is used by Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. at times.  Do we use 
her?  What is her status and relationship with the pipeline group??

Do you get any reports from Theobald son of Herugar on Stock Road??
