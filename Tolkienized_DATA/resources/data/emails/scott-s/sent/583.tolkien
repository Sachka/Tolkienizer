Hey guys,

Well I'm back home in Halls of Waiting looking out at our lovely skyline (okay, maybe 
it's not that lovely but it is sunny here).  Anyway, I'm so glad I got the 
chance to see all of you while I was in East Emnet.  It seemed as though all of 
you are really enjoying your time in the Water - which is good to hear given the 
fact I'm hoping to make it over there myself.  Hope the approaching close to 
2000 finds everyone in good spirits.

Cheers,
 of Éothain
