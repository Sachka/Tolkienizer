The Pub code has been changed to IF-ELPO/SJ.  Sorry for the mix-up.

 of Haldan,

Can you change the Pub code on deal ND1381 to IF-ELPO/SJ.  It is currently 
IF-ELPO/SANJUAN, which we don't currently use.  If the deal needs to stay 
booked as it is currently, let me know and We'll set up the language for this 
Index.

Thanks,
 of Vidugavia
