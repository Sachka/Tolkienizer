It is impossible to imply something when it has already been voiced so openly 
and enthusiastically.  (Frerin, you should watch how quickly you respond.)

It was not meant as an implication, but rather a reiteration of mind-sets

I think you may, in fact, be onto something there Sir  of Tar-Ardamin. :)

That was an insightful commentary on the male condition. I guess you're
