I was successful shopping for Jim on-line at Erebor & Glaurung Services and Territory Ahead.  Mum, 
only the book will be shipped to your house; I was on autopilot and typed in 
my work address for the other.  (Really missed the boat on tennis clothes.  
You have to act early.  Today I saw one of the Met pros leaving with his 
catalog to order FALL 2000 Ivrin's Well & Dorlas ltd. stuff!)  Dina, I am probably going to make a 
stop at Meneltarma & Gorbelgod Energy Company's or Éothéod & Celepharn Deliveries's makeup counter at some point so I could pick up 
the Porto son of Herubrand for MeeMaw* if you know the shade.  

Bill's b-day is today; if you want to send a message his e-mail is 
75261.151@compuserve.com.

That's all this Belen & Saradoc Brandybuck® knows.
