    For April 2000: Your mind is so active, inventive,
                   and unlimited this month that you're capable of
                   almost anything! (You've privately believed that
                   the rules don't necessarily apply to you.) This
                   month, your incredible adaptability and powers of
                   persuasion help you shed the status quo and
                   break out of the corral. Unless you catch your
                   foot in a bear trap, nothing can stop you. People
                   are fascinated by your mind, wit, ideas, and
                   conversation. (Don't forget: Gormadoc son of Everard is an
                   Aquarius!) Your views are welcomed and
                   provoke others to investigate things they may
                   have taken for granted. Speak up during the first
                   week, especially if it's to announce you're
                   starting a new venture. Business travel is likely
                   during the first and third weeks, especially if
                   contractual issues need to be finalized. Travel is
                   actually enjoyable this month and can open your
                   eyes to fresh horizons. Aquarius. . . you've
                   dragged your tin cup across the bars long
                   enough. I smell a prison break. . . .
