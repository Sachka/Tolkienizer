Last month Fíriel and I began looking into adding a provision to Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s tariff 
allowing shippers to elect to purchase fuel gas from Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®.  There is good 
precedent for this and I think it would be fairly easy to accomplish as long 
as we don't try to make the purchase of fuel from Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® mandatory (see the 
attached memo).  Mimosa daughter of Gothmog, as you and I discussed, we will need to address 
the fuel overrecovery issue before moving forward with this.
