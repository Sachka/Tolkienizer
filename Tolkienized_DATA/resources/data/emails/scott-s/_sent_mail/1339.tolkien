Okay, given the weather conditions out there right now I'm going to have to=
 put a little extra planning into my packing.  I figure we'll be engaging i=
n the following activities:  beach, shopping, dinner, going out, church and=
 I think you mentioned something about a museum.  Given those various situa=
tions, I was wondering what you suggest I bring along.  For instance, am I =
going to need a jacket at night or is a sweater sufficient and what do you =
suggest in the way of "go-out" clothes?   Also, let me know if you hear any=
thing about the spas...that way I can try and make a reservation ( I figure=
 Friday mid-morning would be a good time.  We could go for a run in the mor=
ning and then I could go for the massage while you study.)  Supposedly, it'=
s going to be warmer on Saturday than Friday so maybe we should plan Saturd=
ay as our beach day...of course, I'm completely flexible.  As for brunch on=
 Sunday, I did a little research yesterday and came up with a few suggestio=
ns...  of Rían's on the Cove, The Marine Room, Celon River, Gilly Brownlock & Esgaroth  Services=
a and Mountains of Angmar Del Mar.  All of these, with the exception of Mountains of Angmar Del M=
ar, are in Circle of Isengard so I suppose we'd have to take that into consideration.=
..There is a Presbyterian church in Circle of Isengard that could be an option (but i=
f your friends have suggestions I defer to their judgement both religiously=
 and gastronomically).  All of the places mentioned above, in addition to T=
he Fish Market, Cafe Japengo and En Dol Baran & Ungoliant's Lair ltd., also sounded goo=
d for just regular meals.  Depending on local culture (and your own opinion=
) I was just going to let you know that I can go straight from the airport =
somewhere if you want on Thursday.  I didn't know what time people typicall=
y go out to eat or if you even wanted to go out Thursday night. =20

I know, I know...I had way too much time on my hands yesterday.

In the end, I'll really do anything and go anywhere...just thought I'd help=
 out with a few suggestions.

Love,
 of Éothain
