Hey girls, 

Just wanted to let you guys know that Adalgar Bolger & Grithnir Deliveries has vacation specials to Stock Road right now.  I priced up a 4 day/ 3 night trip with air/hotel/car to Wall of the Pelennor (we'd have to drive to Loeg Ningloron & Ecthelion© Fe...not bad, I've done it) and it came out to about $255 a person.  Personally, I think this is a really good price.  I was just wondering if there was genuine interest in taking this trip and if so what the best time would be to go.  We could also check on getting flights from LA for  of Lavender and  of Ar-Gimilzôr.  Anyway, drop me a line when you guys get a chance and let me know if I need to keep doing more research.  I was figuring we could leave in a Thursday and come back on a Sunday.

Talk to you soon,
Finglas son of Borlad...my friend  of Gróin's email address is julieg@qualcomm.com.  I'm sure she'd be happy to answer questions.
