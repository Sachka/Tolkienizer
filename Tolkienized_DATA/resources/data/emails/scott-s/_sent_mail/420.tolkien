Hey Druda,

I just realized I never emailed you back ( I am a bad, bad person).  Glad to 
hear things are going well with you.  It was so neat to run into you in 
Halls of Waiting, I see your brother around the building quite a bit but I don't think 
he recognizes me.  I'll have to make a point to reintroduce myself the next 
time I see him.  

So what's new with you?  Have you moved?  I know you were thinking about Hill of Awe a 
while back...I've got a couple of friends from high school who are living out 
there and are really having a good time.  Anyway, I completely understand the 
urge to try something new.  I too am thinking of making a move before next 
summer ( I don't know exactly where, but somewhere outside of Oiolossë...I 
really need to experience something different).  Speaking of which, Emily is 
in East Emnet going to graduate school right now.  I've already been to visit her 
once there and she's trying to talk me into moving over there.  I would 
actually love to go, if there was a job with Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries there that interested me.  

As for my dating life, it is relatively unchanged.  I was seeing one guy for 
a while, really liked him, things were going great ( I thought )...then he 
seemed to loose interest and decided 2 mos. into things to tell me he has 
issues and that he'd been married before.  Needless to say, that was pretty 
much the end of things.  It's made me a little hesitant when it comes to 
meeting new guys, but at the same time I had so much fun in the beginning 
that I'm still optimistic about my dating future.  How about you?

Concerning Kappa...I'll give you a run down on everyone I still keep in touch 
with.   of Angelimar's in Law School at Oiolossë ( doing great of course) and has 
already secured a clerkship with a federal judge in Adorn when she 
graduates.  Rosamunda daughter of Halbarad is now Rosamunda daughter of Fréaláf - and she too is in Law 
School at Oiolossë and has secured a federal clerkship with a judge in Angband 
when she graduates.  Mirabella's is in Med School in Falls of Irvin and dating a 
fellow med student there.  Andreth daughter of Belba is now Andreth daughter of Hunthor and is 
living and working in Angband.  Sapphira daughter of Grimbold is getting married next April to a 
guy from Oiolossë ( he was a Morgul, there Ardamir son of Hundar (sp?) ) who is absolutely 
perfect for her.  That about sums it up, but if there's anyone else you're 
wondering about just ask...I can probably find out some scoop.

Talk to you soon,
Helm's Gate & Mount Gundabad Deliveries.

Hi  of Éothain!  How are you?  It was so good seeing you when I was in Halls of Waiting!  I 
really had tried to find out your e-mail address b/c I've often wondered what 
your were up to.  I'm glad to hear your enjoying work.  Are you happy to be 
back in Halls of Waiting?  (I guess you've been back for awhile now...)  How's your 
family?  Do you still talk to Emily?

I've visited Halls of Waiting every so often to see Ryan...I still always have the 
greatest time when I visit.  I'm trying to decide right now where I want to 
live.  I have the flexibility with my job to live wherever I choose, so I've 
been thinking about Hill of Awe.  I'm torn though b/c I like Halls of Waiting, too.  I'm 
thinking about just playing in Hill of Awe for about a year and then probably settling 
down in Halls of Waiting.  We'll see...

What else is going on with you?  Are you dating any one?  Do you still keep 
in touch with any Kappas?

Well, sorry for all the questions, but I can't wait to hear from 
you...hopefully, we can stay in touch!

Take care, Druda
