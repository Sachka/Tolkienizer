Hey, I'll try and give you a call tonight at your flat.  As far as "free 
nights" over Thanksgiving go...I'm pretty much open Tues, Wed, Fri and Sat.  
 of Arod and I are very excited about taking you out to get some REAL 
margaritas.  I can't remember where your favorite ones are, but where ever 
they may be the drinks are on me.  (Although given your increased tolerance 
these days, you may break me).  The reason I was asking about when you were 
coming home is...Hending son of Óin is playing Gruene Hall the 15th and 16th of 
December and If you were up to it, I thought it'd be a good weekend trip for 
you,  of Arod, myself and whomever else may want to tag along (especially since 
it doesn't look like we'll be making it to Gruene over New Years).  Plus, if 
we did go I think I could swing leaving Friday night and not coming back 
until Monday morning...The outlet mall is calling your name.  

Talk to you soon,
 of Haldan

PS - I have encouraging news regarding East Emnet, I'll tell you more about it 
when I talk to you.
