Recently we approved a "based on utilization" rate in another contract -- the 
rationale was that our minimum reservation charge is zero -- so on those days 
they don't use the point, the amount allocated to reservation component 
(using our discretion to allocate between reservation and commodity) is $0 
and it's still within our minimum so it is not a negotiated rate.  Does that 
make sense to you?

OK?  Is the per unit rate for the Cal Border deliveries kosher on a firm 
contract?  DF
