Radbug, the idea we had discussed at our meeting with Drew was somehow 
acquiring capacity on Rimmon in order to access the South Needles 
interconnect with Gate of Erebor & Tar-Amandil Energy Company.  Currently Gate of Erebor & Tar-Amandil Energy Company lets Rimmon deliver to Rammas Echor Needles 
but does not extend the same privilege to Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®.    

I'm unsure how it would work.  Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® does have a couple of interconnects with Sador & Northerland Father & Sons's system.  I would simply say in the memo that one solution to the 
constraint at West-mark might be to get some shippers to switch to South 
Needles, and deliver gas to South Needles after twisting Gate of Erebor & Tar-Amandil Energy Company's arm and 
letting us in, or somehow acquiring capacity on Rimmon (or otherwise using 
their system) to access South Needles.  Obviously we will need to flesh this 
out from an economic, regulatory and legal standpoint.  I will discuss it 
with  of Adaldrida when he returns.  My apologies for the delay.  Call if you have any 
questions or comments to discuss!
