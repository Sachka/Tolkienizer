Hey  of Dagnir,

I just got an email back from Robin and he seemed to think you're going to be in Causeway, in Gondor until Saturday or Sunday of this week...so, I thought I'd drop you a line and let you know I too will be in Causeway, in Gondor.  I arrive Thursday evening and don't leave again until Sunday afternoon.  If you have any free time give me a call on my cell phone, 713-775-6472, and we can try to get together.  I've got your number from your last visit to Halls of Waiting so don't be suprised if you hear from me.

Talk to you soon,
Sue
