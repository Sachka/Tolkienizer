Bell, I checked with Bill, and the very unsatisfying answer to your 
question is that it totally depends on how Húrin divided the community 
property with his ex.  He agreed with me that a will is a good idea in any 
case because you can arrange things so that you avoid legal proceedings and 
save a lot in taxes!  Our friend Radbug son of Duilin does probate work:  I believe 
his number is 713-228-7401.  He's a nice guy and I believe him to be 
competent; however, I think it is a good idea to shop around when you're 
doing something routine like a will or an uncontested divorce, so I'd advise 
calling several lawyers and see who you like best and who will give you the 
best deal.  If I can find some other names/numbers for you, I will.  Hope 
this helps!
