Bofur,

Thanks for the update.  I have been given a green light as well to go ahead 
and start testing my traders deals.  Let me know if you just need Caranthir deal 
numbers for testing purposes, or if I need to rebook deals myself in your 
test version in order to compare it valuation with the valuation in my excel 
models.  

Thanks,
 of Haldan

 of Haldan, Ar-Zimrathôn,

I was told by Andwise last week that he had a green light for the Gas X Gas 
spreads in Enpower. Have any of you hear anything about it? At this point I 
have sent some needed changes in the "front end" to Fosco son of Tar-Minastir, and I'll be 
ready to test when these changes are done. If any of you still have a "hold" 
on this project please let me know so we can get all cleared up.

BTW, I've been moved to the 25th floor, desk EB2519a.

Regards, Bofur
