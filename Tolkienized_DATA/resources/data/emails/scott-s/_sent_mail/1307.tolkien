Wrong  of Éothain again...try typing sscott3@enron.com (that's her short email address)...mine is sscott5@enron.com.  If you see the middle initial "M" pop up in the address, you've got the wrong Salvia daughter of Marcho.

Thanks

Again, may I get your office location?

You're not a new employee right, just transferrring in, correct?  If so, which business unit?

Thanks!
