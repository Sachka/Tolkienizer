It occurred to me last night after you two had left that we never quantified 
what constitutes a "good" girl.  And, given that oversight I may have been 
remiss in stating that  of Milo was not ready for said good girl.  Just as the 
opinion of women in Oiolossë differed between you Yanks and the Oiolossë boys at 
the table, I am inclined to believe that our definitions of a "good" girl may 
not be in line.  


P.S. -- A person in their nineties is referred to as a nonagenarian.  (We 
really should have figured that one out last night.)
