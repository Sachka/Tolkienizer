I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect 
agreement with Forest of Region, and have determined we may do so only if we take 
the following steps:

1.  Terminate the Fíriel Fairbairn & Elros Father & Sons by giving 30 days notice to Forest of Region.  Paragraph 13 
of the 6/1/94 Fíriel Fairbairn & Elros Father & Sons with Forest of Region (as successor in interest to Tol Brandir & Agathurush Energy Company) 
provides that either party may terminate the Fíriel Fairbairn & Elros Father & Sons "at the end of the primary 
term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice" to 
Forest of Region.  (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since 
gone month-to-month.)

2.  On the effective termination date of the Fíriel Fairbairn & Elros Father & Sons, terminate the interconnect 
agreement by giving 30 days notice to Forest of Region.    The 12/31/92 
Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either 
party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary 
term.  This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire 
until 12/31/02.  However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement "may 
be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in 
the event the Fíriel Fairbairn & Elros Father & Sons between the parties is terminated."

As we've already discussed, termination of the agreement is an extreme 
measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh 
our other options first.  Let me know if you have further questions.
