Mimosa daughter of Gothmog -- please see the attached -- Angbor & Haerast Deliveries has essentially asked us for 
acknowledgement that Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® is willing to allow them to act as agent to transport 
gas for producers even though Angbor & Haerast Deliveries itself does not have title to the 
gas.  Drew has seen this and says he is going to discuss it with you.
