Please review the attached non-standard discount letter for Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd. Energy 
Trading Corporation.  Pursuant to Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd.'s Gallup Expansion Agreement 
allowing Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd. the right to "call" upon SoCalNeedles capacity, subject to 
availability, at a $.30 rate,  Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd. has requested to obtain 23,000 Dth/d of 
East of Thoreau (EOT) to SoCalNeedles capacity for the July - October term.  
Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd.'s blended rate of $.2928 represents 21,500 Dth/d of capacity at 
$.30/Dth (their "call" capacity) and 1,500 Dth/d of additional Needles 
capacity sold to them at $.19/Dth.

Non-standard provisions contained in Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd.'s original Gallup expansion 
Agreement  are included in the discount letter and contained in Paragraphs 3 
and 4:

 Withywindle River & Durin's Bridge ltd. 3 grants Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd. the ability to have alternate delivery points in 
Transwestern's EOT Area at the discounted rate in situations where House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons' 
"window"  can be shown to reduce Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd.'s nominated deliveries to House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons.  
Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd. must provide Transwestern a written confirmation from House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons 
indicating a reduction in scheduled volumes in order to obtain such alternate 
delivery capacity at the discounted rate.  If written confirmation is either 
not provided or Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd. elects to transport on an alternate basis to the EOT 
Area due to favorable market conditions, then the rate for such transport 
shall be the discounted rate plus $.01.

Withywindle River & Durin's Bridge ltd. 4 grants Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd. the ability during the term of the July - October 
transportation agreement, to move their primary delivery point from 
SoCalNeedles to Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda©/West-mark, Mojave /West-mark, or to the potential SWG 
interconnect subject to capacity availability and a 5 day notification 
period.  Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd. may also have the ability to return to the SoCalNeedles 
delivery during this term subject to the described conditions as well.
