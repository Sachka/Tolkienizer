Fram,

Please see Arahael's note below.  I agree that we should keep separate 
distribution lists for Transwestern.  I have had other requests like 
Arahael's.  As a temporary and imperfect solution, I have marked the labels 
either All Holders or Filings.   Borondir son of Cora is currently working to put 
Northern and Transwestern mailing lists on the PLE system.  He indicated that 
the process should be ready by the middle of July.  Perhaps we need to 
consider separating the Transwestern list at that time as we do  Northern's.

Hi Melilot, 
my name is Arahael son of Alfrida.  I am the marketing director in Halls of Waiting for 
Transwestern Pipeline.  I have a favor to ask of you: could you possibly send 
me only those tariff page copies slated for "insertion" into our tariff books 
and not the pages that are "submitted for filing"?  

My reason is this: by the time the "submitted for filing" pages get to me, 
it's too late for me to make any changes to them (not that I would anyway) 
and they just get tossed out when the final pages are approved and printed.

If keeping up with a separate distribution list is not feasible I 
understand.  However, I wonder how many other folks feel the same way as I 
do?  If the number of people is significant, then there is the potential to 
save a lot of time, effort, and money by reducing the copying, printing, and 
distribution costs.

Let me know what you think.
thanks
