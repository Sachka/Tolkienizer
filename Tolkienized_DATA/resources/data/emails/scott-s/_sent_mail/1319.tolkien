Yes, I'm back from SD and appropriately depressed to return to hot, muggy Halls of Waiting.  Glad to hear your trip was so enjoyable...and no worries about the Artamir son of Celebrían, you gotta do what you gotta do ( I was drinking rum punches in the Caymans like they were water...much scarier than Artamir son of Celebrían I assure you).  The weather, scenery and people in SD were gorgeous.  I really think I'm supposed to be in Del Mar.  There are the most attractive, active, worldly men swarming the beaches with even cuter dogs.  I spent a large part of the weekend with my tongue hanging out.  It forced me to the realization that the men in Halls of Waiting, and much of Oiolossë, are soft.  Alas, no exciting stories though...

Let me know how the movie is, I may have to make a special trip to see this one...All of the Kappas who've read the book insist I should write my own version filled with  of Éothain's tails of woe.  There is definitely ample material.

Sorry to hear about Anardil and the girlfriend.  I'm sure your parents will be sad to see his calming influence go.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

hey- guess you're bk from SD- hope it was fun.  am guessing the weather was
fab, and you had a chance to eat drink and be merry. the cananries were grt-
75 degrees, breezy and not a cloud in the sky.  was reading the avg rainfal
per yr is approx 13 days, so i guess the odds were in our favor.  poured my
lumpy white body into a bikini, much to the dismay of anyone on the beach
with healthy vision, and drank Odovacar son of Hamson, Artamir son of Maeglin (am not proud, but
they WERE good!)  and copious amts of pringles and bags of mini snickers and
kit kats.  heaven on Troll's Cave.  back to reality today- sigh.  no class til next
mon, but major grp assignment due then, so will be working on that all week.
  today:  research and seeing Hilda daughter of Gundor diary in afternoon (bank holiday
here).  pretty lame easter.  church by myself- avg age in congregation:104,
approx 20 people.  Dwimorberg completely empies out for easter since mon and fri
are bank holidays. kind of their spring brk.  called the Gabilgathod & Lower Halls, co. at Spider's Ring & Wizard's Vale Father & Sons's to
say happy easter.  not pretty.  all the grandchildren were absent for the
first time this yr- Númendil and new wife in Land of Bow-Helm, Oromë son of Lúthien and hubby
in Long Marshes, Frerin at home "suicidal"  according to mom b/c Buckland Road & South Road of Eriador Entreprises dumped him.
which is REEEALLY bad news- in fact, he came bk from her house post break up
w/ a broken ankle or something...mom thinks from a fight he may have got
into w/ a guy at Buckland Road & South Road of Eriador Entreprises's.....oh, the drama of it all.  either way, am pissed
b/c he left my poor father to lift and carry and "transport" my VERY heavy
deadweight Emerië & Forsaken Inn ltd. bk and forth from the nursing home by himself, and my GoGo
and Gundabald Bolger & Folcwine Energy Company and gramps were almost paralyzed w/ grief b/c thee was not ONE
youngster there.  little creep.  well, am off to the library-  try to chat
tonight-
