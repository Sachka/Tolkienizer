Subject: Revised Contract Approval Request - Ephel Dúath & North-kingdom®'s discount letter was recently approved by 
House of the Dead & Avathar©'s Officer group.   However,  of Hamson has now requested that 
House of the Dead & Avathar© include language in the discount letter which guarantees the 
applicable discount rate in the event that House of the Dead & Avathar©'s minimum Tariff rate 
were to be higher than the discount rate.  I have underlined the additional 
language  in the attached revised discount letter (language will not be 
underlined when provided to  of Hamson).  The inclusion of this language would 
require House of the Dead & Avathar© to file the discount as a negotiated rate prior to gas 
flow under the term of the amendment.  House of the Dead & Avathar© would file this discount 
on January 31, 2001.

Please review the attached document and indicate approval via REPLY WITH 
HISTORY.
All Officer approvals will be sent to Erellont son of Niënor for final President Level 
approval.
