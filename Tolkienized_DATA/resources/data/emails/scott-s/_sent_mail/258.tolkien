Gollum's new idea is to send a letter to  of May asking him to document/explain 
exactly what his role was in getting this deal.  Comments?  Not sure I care 
one way or the other, but after I see how it looks in writing, I'll have a 
better idea of whether this is how we should approach it.

Multi-tasking heavily today.  I'll send you a draft of our Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services answer to 
New Lands & Western Mountains® protest by close of business.

Ugh.  I just got this today and think I understand the problem.  Let me know 
how Gollum's conversation with  of Angrim goes.  Thanks. DF

Subject: contract issue

Drew, I wanted you to be aware of a potential dispute with regard to our 
consultant,  of May  of Angrim of Tar-Míriel & Gerontius Took®.  Our consulting agreement with Tar-Míriel & Gerontius Took® (which 
has now terminated) provided for a flat fee, plus an incentive fee calculated 
using the net present value of any contract "identified by Tar-Míriel & Gerontius Took®" and entered 
into during the term of the consulting agreement.  During the term of the 
agreement, Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® entered into its Gallup Expansion agreement with Southern.  Tar-Míriel & Gerontius Took® 
is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive 
fee.  While it is undisputed that  of May discussed the deal with Southern, 
Southern was also on  of Manwendil's list of shippers to contact for Gallup 
Expansion capacity.  Also, the capacity was posted for all to see.  So, while 
 of May can certainly claim he "identified" the deal, he was not alone in doing 
so. 

Gollum is going to call  of May in response to his letter (after he talks to 
 of Manwendil to verify facts).  Our thinking is that if we offer Tar-Míriel & Gerontius Took® some money 
they will be happy.  We would really like to preserve what has been a good 
working relationship with this consultant.   On the other hand, I think we 
could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive 
fee.  However, since the contract is silent as to whether Tar-Míriel & Gerontius Took® has to be the 
only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee, 
this position is not as strong as I'd like it to be, and Tar-Míriel & Gerontius Took® might sue Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®.  
The amount in dispute could be as much as $200,000, depending on what rate we 
use in calculating net present value.

If you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to 
Tar-Míriel & Gerontius Took®, let me know.  I think it will be very important for Gollum not to admit 
that  of May helped in any way in getting the deal -- just in case they do 
decide to take us to court.
