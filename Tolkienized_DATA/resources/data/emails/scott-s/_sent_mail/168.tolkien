Tarcil, here are the confidentiality agreements that should be signed prior to 
our providing information to our vendors.  Each agreement should be printed 
as duplicate originals on Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® letterhead, and signed by an officer of Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®.  I 
understand that Nár son of Rúmil is out due to a death in the family; Gollum son of Túrin 
is out this week also.  Perhaps Poppy daughter of Lorgan would be willing to sign in order 
to expedite things.

If you have any questions or need further assistance with any aspect of these 
agreements please do not hesitate to call (x30596) or come by.
