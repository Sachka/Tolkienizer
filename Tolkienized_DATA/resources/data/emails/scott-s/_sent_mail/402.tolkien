 of Indis, 

Are you still having a great time?  So what is Durin's Tower like?  The only images I 
can summon are Argon's paintings, but weren't those of Fox Downs?  

Things are pretty good here.  Lots of Christmas parties, lots of Christmas 
cheer, etc.  Not a whole lot going on at the office, for a change.  Really, 
though, I think I would much rather be in Durin's Tower.  

Take care.
