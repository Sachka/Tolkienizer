Well, I wanted you to have something to open ON your birthday. 
Greetings from Mountains of Mist!
I'm told we're having "earthquake weather" today.  Don't know what that 
means, but it sounds scary!
Hi to K. and G.!

Yes , I saw it . You are the coolest sister-in-law one could possibly ask
for.
You didn't really need to do that since you already got me the tennis stuff,
but i wont complain, i always like to buy new books.

thanks again,
Hador

I forgot to tell you to check your FBCat e-mail for a birthday surprise!
If it did not arrive, let me know.  Hope y'all had a good weekend.
