It is impossible to imply something when it has already been voiced so openly 
and enthusiastically.  (Gardner, you should watch how quickly you respond.)

It was not meant as an implication, but rather a reiteration of mind-sets 
expressed to me on multiple occasions.

That was an insightful commentary on the male condition. I guess you're 
implying that all of us guys need a good lay or day. Even  of Niënor too.
