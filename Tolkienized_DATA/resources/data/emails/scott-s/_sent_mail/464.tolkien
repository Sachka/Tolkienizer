Hey  of Milo,

Yep, I'm still in Halls of Waiting for the time being...I'll probably be here through 
March of next year when my current rotation ends.  Everything's going pretty 
well, work is still consisting of long hours but I think ultimately the hard 
work is going to pay off.  In fact, the whole East Emnet thing is looking pretty 
good right now.  There might be an opportunity for me to get into some 
structuring and originating roles over there which is much more along the 
lines of where I'd like to go (versus this whole trader support thing - great 
experience for the time being, but definitely not a permanent role).  Glad to 
hear things are still well with you.  Sounds like you're still the same old 
 of Milo...working deals and hooking-up.  You'll have to let me know when 
you're going to be in town so we can get the gang together to go out.  It 
looks like Beregar's going to be back in town for about 6 weeks or so coming 
up so hopefully we could all make a steak night reunion.  

I've been going out quite a bit as well and have had a couple dates, but 
nothing really to speak of.  I was kind of on a rampage over the last month 
just messing with guys heads (flirting, getting them to buy me drinks, giving 
them my number and then completely ignoring them).  I think it was some need 
I had to treat your entire gender like shit.  I'm pretty much over it 
though.  It's not really in my nature to be like that, just a reactionary 
thing for having been treated like crap myself.  

Keep in touch and let me know when you're going to be in town.

 of Éothain

to East Emnet.

All is well here...well work is very stressful, but it's cool and i do love 
my job despite all the bitching i do.
It's just a lot of strss.
I've made some big move and actually won a big project over a VP.
You will be seing me soon in Halls of Waiting. (can't tell you more)

Anyway
Partying like crazy..that's all I do..girls..girls...and more girls...i can't 
even remember all their names OUPS>
Still in love with  of Tar-Telperiën, and no she is still not in my life and yes she is 
still in Halls of Waiting...I hope life helps a little on this one.
Partying..like 4-5 times a week..
But above all, working out like an animal. It's been really good and i'm 
starting to look like i did at Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries...a machine.
Running a lot and working out...

So what is up with you?
