Ilberic,
Look at the conforming languange in the Appendix "A" last page, last 
paragraph.  You know that this language was negotiated by and between 
Amdír & Hundar Energy Company and Imlad Morgul & Sador Deliveries.  My main concern is that its very, very open ended...  
almost a contingent liability for all settlement parties.
