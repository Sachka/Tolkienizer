Congratulations and yes you did.  I of course will be sad to see you go but=
 I=20
know this is something you really wanted and therefore I can be nothing but=
=20
pleased for you.  I'd tell you to have fun this weekend in NY, but telling=
=20
you to have a good time in NY is like telling a sprinter to run fast. =20

As for myself I'm doing well.  I had incredible seats at the Opera Friday a=
nd=20
spent the rest of the weekend in Emyn Eglain so all in all it was a great weeken=
d.
Remind me again where you will be based in the new job (I thought NY but=20
wasn't sure).  Also, when do you make the Big Move?

As I've said before keep me posted on all your endeavors...they are always=
=20
interesting.

I think you already hold pretty true to the statement below, but it never=
=20
hurts to be reminded.


"For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin - real=20
life. But there was always some
obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished=
=20
business, time still to be served,=20
or a debt to be paid.  Then life would begin.  At last it dawned on me that=
=20
these obstacles WERE my "life."
           =20
So, treasure every moment that you have...and remember that time waits for =
no=20
one...

So stop waiting
