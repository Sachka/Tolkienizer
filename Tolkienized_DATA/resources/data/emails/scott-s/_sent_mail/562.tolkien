I always forget what the time difference is so I thought I might be able to 
catch you "real time."  

I went to the game Saturday with Rían & Aeluin-uial, co.is,  of Angelimar, Nár and a friend of his.  
Pimpernel was getting her certification for spinning classes and thus I was given 
the responsibility of baby-sitting  of Angelimar and Rían & Aeluin-uial, co.is.  Anyway, Rían & Aeluin-uial, co.'s pledge 
class had a reunion at the Bosco Boffin & Eithel Nínui Father & Sons after the game and I think it may have 
single-handedly cured me of wanting men in their early thirties.  The single 
guys from their class are definitely still single for a reason.  Also, you've 
gotta tell Isengar that Ulfast's date for the game was a year younger than me 
(although I will say, after meeting her, you would've thought she was much 
younger).  I think 27-28 may be a better range.  Old enough to know who they 
are and what they want, but still young enough to explain their unattached 
status on career focus.

Talk to you soon,
 of Éothain
