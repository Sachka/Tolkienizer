Since you may or may not return my call I thought I would shoot you an
email.  I'm sorry for keeping you out soo late on Wednesday and anything
else that you may be upset about.  Anyway I will be in Emyn Eglain on Saturday
night and was hoping we could meet up.  The only thing is I have no way of
getting a hold of you.  So, here is my cell number and I should at least
have this until the end of November:  281-216-5005.  I already got Vic's and
Fengel's number so maybe we can all hook up on sixth street.  You can always
respond to this or give me a call with your number.  I may swing by Inzilbêth's
happy hour tonight so maybe I'll see you there.

Kyle

By the way I have never been married and I'm not 28 yet.
