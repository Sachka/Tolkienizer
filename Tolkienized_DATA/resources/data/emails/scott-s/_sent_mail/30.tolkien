I am not sure about Goldilocks daughter of Túrin but maybe Drew or Salvia daughter of Marcho know. I do 
not get reports from anyone else regarding activities in any state.

Steve - is Goldilocks daughter of Zamîn(sp?) an Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries employee?   I know she once was, but I 
believe she lives in Stock Road and is used by Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries at times.  Do we use 
her?  What is her status and relationship with the pipeline group??

Do you get any reports from Huor son of Mallor on Stock Road??
