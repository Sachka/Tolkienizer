Subject: Great Southern Forests & Mount of the Pine Trees Father & Sons,

 Please review the following guaranty sent to us by  & Eastlands of Númenor® 
(Eldamar & Hill of Ilmarin ltd.).  Eldamar & Hill of Ilmarin ltd. and Onodló & Gamling Father & Sons will each guaranty 50% of the obligations of Enovate ( I 
think the guaranty may have a different name- I'll fix it).

 Please review and let me know if it is acceptable or make necessary changes.

Thanks,
Ted
