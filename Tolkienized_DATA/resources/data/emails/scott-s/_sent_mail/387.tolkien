Since the 311 belt/suspenders approach didn't quite fit, I've had to try to 
convince GrimbeornFerny that he ought to rely on the Dor Daidelos & Elendur Deliveries Sec. 1 exemption for 
gatherers (Hasufelthe Young and  of Hallas concur with us on this, by the way).  He 
is not convinced yet, although he is unable to cite any authority for his 
proposition that being a shipper on Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® would subject a gathering company to 
Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises jurisdiction.  I pointed out that Agave, the owner and operator of an 
extensive gathering system that interconnects with Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s system, has for many 
years been a shipper on Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®.  Also, Fíriel has found that Angbor & Haerast Deliveries already has 
a long-term transportation contract on another interstate system, 
Old Forest Road & Kirith Ungol Deliveries, so if Ferny's theory is right they are going to jail 
anyway!

Angbor & Haerast Deliveries also seems to be hung up on our requirement that shippers have 
title to the gas they ship.  At this point  of Manwendil and I believe they might 
just be looking for any excuse to get out of the deal.  If anything 
interesting happens I'll let you know.
