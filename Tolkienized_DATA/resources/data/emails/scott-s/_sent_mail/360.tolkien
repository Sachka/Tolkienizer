Hey K!  Thanks for the note.  Everyone is asking how you're doing.  Sorry to 
hear about your back; I know what it is like.  As much as you are inclined to 
run around and get things done, the thing that worked best for me with my 
back problem was just to recline as much as possible!  My house truly became 
a mess, but guess what, the world did not end.  

I really like your monosyllabic choices for names:   of Dís and  of Tar-Atanamir.  For some 
reason I really like the name Elizabeth with both of those.  Perhaps because 
it balances out the unisex quality of the first name.  I think you really 
have to meet the baby before you decide for sure.  Who knows, she might turn 
out to be more of a Estella!  heh, heh!

The landscapers are almost finished with my yard.  It looks really good.  I 
even have a little Limlint -- required for the Heights.  The last thing is 
to finish the driveway -- right now there are 20 tons of black star gravel 
sitting in the back yard!

Time to work.
Try to take it easy!  
S

Hey  of Éothain! Sorry no e-mail lately. Things have been busy at work. I am also
tardy on my xmas thankyou notes so I'm hoping a computer one will suffice
for you! What would Miss Manners say? Needless to say we love all the stuff
you gave us. I am enjoying the knives - what a difference they make. No more
sawing!  Iorlas has worn his new shirt many times and loves the book. I too
thought it was a good Christmas, despite the pre-Christmas funk many of us
went through! It all turned out ok - even our time with Hildigard wasn't so
bad!

Things are moving along in baby world. P-nut is moving downwards,
alleviating the pain in my ribs, but now causing sciatica (sp?)  in my right
hip and leg. I feel creaky and it hurts to walk. Not cool - I have too many
things left to do around the house to have to stay off my feet. Oh well. i
suppose it will all get done. We are still searching for the right name and
now need some input since we can't seem to make a decision between us. Here
are our latest choices in no particular order -  of Vairë,  of Dís,  of Tar-Atanamir,
 of Beregar,  of Almiel, and Finduilas (may be too popular). My favorite combination
is Frerinthe Bowman. Iorlas likes  of Dís Elizabeth Shelton or  of Dís Alison.
Yes, we know  of Dís is usually a boy's name, but we had a female intern at Faerie & Saradas Brandybuck Entreprises
one summer named  of Dís and I thought it was cool. One of my baby name books
has both  of Dís and  of Tar-Atanamir on the "truly unisex names" list. Any comments or
new suggestions are appreciated!

Must get going on work. Hope to hear from you soon.

Mimosa
