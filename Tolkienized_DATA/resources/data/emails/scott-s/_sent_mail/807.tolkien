 of Cemendur, I treasure your NY attitude.  I think part of the reason you find so 
few hotties in Halls of Waiting/Oiolossë is that travel and exposure add such an 
intangible element to a person and very few Oiolossë girls have experienced 
either.

        I think everyone has a different definition of good, some more 
lenient some more stringent.  At least that has been my experience.

good to see your not to pist off at my NY attitude and my dicking around last 
night.
I was just busting balls for the hell of it..cause some of these texans are 
complitely uncultured .....makes me laugh.
And no all girls are not FAT in Halls of Waiting...but there are not that many hotties 
Vs. the great cities of the world.
It was fun though and i value your good humour and attitude. 

How to define a good girl.....or rather how do we define "good"
