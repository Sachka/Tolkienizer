At Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises's request we are not going to say anything about long-term having a 
higher priority than short-term, because their tariff simply does not reflect 
this.  Unfortunately it would have made our argument stronger if we could 
have said it, but ...

Anyway, I like what Amroth has done here.  If there is no objection I'm going 
to have him make the change described above and file it tomorrow.

 of Haldan,  This looks fine to me but I want to confirm one statement.  In 
section 3 on page 3 we state that Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises intends to contract for long-term 
capacity vs. short-term capacity and therefore we will have a higher priority 
and will not be the "lowest priority on Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises".  Please confirm that a contract 
for April to October is long term on Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises.  I initially understood we would 
contract for one month with an evergreen provision or rolling month to month 
type of contract therefore I just wanted to make sure this statement fits 
with our Marketing Depts intent.  Thanks.

Fram
