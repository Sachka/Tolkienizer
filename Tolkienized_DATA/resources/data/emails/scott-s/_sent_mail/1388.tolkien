He was over again last night.  Please explain to me why you would invite your "man" over to your apartment when you have a roommate and he lives alone.  I simply do not understand.  I took full advantage of the fact Ted lived alone...we never hung out at my apartment.  Where's the fun in that?  I just think it's weird.

Talk to you later,
Sue
