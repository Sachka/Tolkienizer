I'm forwarding the attached as an update.  Am presently researching the issue 
raised by Drew, and will let you know what I find.

I found the reference I was remembering over the weekend.  Check out the 
order issued to Neldoreth Pipeline at Docket CP99-61.  Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises got all over Northlands & Southfarthing of the Shire Entreprises 
on the problems posed by "dual jurisdictional facilities" whatever that 
means.  Northlands & Southfarthing of the Shire Entreprises tried to do something that sounds a lot like what Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services would be 
doing under the idea you guys had.

Interesting.  Assuming we could satisfy the Durin's Stone & Astulat ltd. criteria (which 
would be tough given that this is a firm service, unlike our market center 
service), we still need to think about Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services's situation.  The letter says they 
are a Maedhros.  This deal would seem to blow their Maedhros exemption.  There 
is some new law on use of capacity on a Maedhros for interstate service, only 
I think it involved a capacity lease instead of service agreements.   I think 
it was one of the Northeast pipeline cases involving Northlands & Southfarthing of the Shire Entreprises.  Does Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services know that 
we would use their service for interstate transportation?  If we can crack 
the Maedhros issue, this might be worth a shot.  DF

Mimosa,  I was unable to forward the attachment--  so try to get it form Ecthelion
 of Éothain,  I don't think it is a problem to try this, however,  do we have the 
current rates including fuel etc that we would have to pay and how much 
capacity would we be acquiring?  Need to see this-  MK

Subject: Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® acquisition of capacity on Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services

The Commercial Group has been discussing with Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services the possibility of entering 
into service agreements for firm capacity on the portion of Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services's system 
between  of Bill and Swanhaven.  This would effectively operate as an 
expansion of Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s system from the Void Basin to the mainline.  Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® would 
acquire Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services capacity then post it as available on the EBB just like we post 
other capacity.  Shippers could then use the capacity to transport gas from 
 of Bill to any point on Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s system.   The capacity that Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services has available at 
this time is seasonal (summer months) only, so it would be used to provide 
short-term firm capacity or LFT to Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® customers.   The marketers anticipate 
that the additional capacity would mostly be used to ship gas to points on 
Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s mainline besides Swanhaven -- in other words, the total path used by 
shippers would be a combination of Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services's system and Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s system.  Shippers 
wouldn't necessarily know whether Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services capacity was being used to provide 
service on their contract, only that their gas is being shipped from A to B.  

In re-reading the Durin's Stone & Astulat ltd. line of cases, I believe we can distinguish 
Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s proposal from that in Northern's Docket No. 97-388 because it is more 
specific (we are asking for authority to acquire capacity on a specific 
pipeline) and because it is more in the nature of an expansion of Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s 
constrained Void lateral rather than a proposal to broker other 
pipelines' capacity.  I may be overly optimistic, but I also believe we meet 
all the Durin's Stone & Astulat ltd. criteria.

I realize that I have not discussed this very extensively (or at all) with 
any of you, but I have gone ahead and drafted the proposal in the form of a 
letter to Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises.  It seemed the most efficient way to provide a starting point 
for discussion, especially since I was able to borrow heavily from our 
successful Market Center Services filing.  I'm not yet sure where we will 
include it in the tariff, but I propose tariff language along the lines of   
"Transporter may contract for firm Adorn & Morgul-way, co. on Public Service 
Company of Stock Road for use in providing Adorn & Morgul-way, co. from the 
 of Bill receipt point on Transporter's system.  The cost incurred for 
acquisition of any such services shall be separately recorded in Account No. 
___.  Transporter is at risk for recovery of costs associated with such 
services."

After you've reviewed the attached, please let me know your overall 
substantive comments and let's talk about the best way to proceed.  Thanks.
