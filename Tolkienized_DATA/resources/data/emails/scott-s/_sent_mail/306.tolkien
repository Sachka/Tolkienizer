I'm forwarding the attached as an update.  Am presently researching the issue 
raised by Drew, and will let you know what I find.

I found the reference I was remembering over the weekend.  Check out the 
order issued to Neldoreth Pipeline at Docket CP99-61.  Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company got all over Tauremorna & Second Gate Energy Company 
on the problems posed by "dual jurisdictional facilities" whatever that 
means.  Tauremorna & Second Gate Energy Company tried to do something that sounds a lot like what Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises would be 
doing under the idea you guys had.

Interesting.  Assuming we could satisfy the Algund & Celegorm Energy Company criteria (which 
would be tough given that this is a firm service, unlike our market center 
service), we still need to think about Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises's situation.  The letter says they 
are a Frumgar.  This deal would seem to blow their Frumgar exemption.  There 
is some new law on use of capacity on a Frumgar for interstate service, only 
I think it involved a capacity lease instead of service agreements.   I think 
it was one of the Northeast pipeline cases involving Tauremorna & Second Gate Energy Company.  Does Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises know that 
we would use their service for interstate transportation?  If we can crack 
the Frumgar issue, this might be worth a shot.  DF

Dina,  I was unable to forward the attachment--  so try to get it form Fram
 of Haldan,  I don't think it is a problem to try this, however,  do we have the 
current rates including fuel etc that we would have to pay and how much 
capacity would we be acquiring?  Need to see this-  MK

Subject: Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises acquisition of capacity on Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises

The Commercial Group has been discussing with Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises the possibility of entering 
into service agreements for firm capacity on the portion of Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises's system 
between  of Treebeard and Swanhaven.  This would effectively operate as an 
expansion of Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's system from the Void Basin to the mainline.  Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises would 
acquire Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises capacity then post it as available on the EBB just like we post 
other capacity.  Shippers could then use the capacity to transport gas from 
 of Treebeard to any point on Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's system.   The capacity that Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises has available at 
this time is seasonal (summer months) only, so it would be used to provide 
short-term firm capacity or LFT to Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises customers.   The marketers anticipate 
that the additional capacity would mostly be used to ship gas to points on 
Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's mainline besides Swanhaven -- in other words, the total path used by 
shippers would be a combination of Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises's system and Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's system.  Shippers 
wouldn't necessarily know whether Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises capacity was being used to provide 
service on their contract, only that their gas is being shipped from A to B.  

In re-reading the Algund & Celegorm Energy Company line of cases, I believe we can distinguish 
Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's proposal from that in Northern's Docket No. 97-388 because it is more 
specific (we are asking for authority to acquire capacity on a specific 
pipeline) and because it is more in the nature of an expansion of Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's 
constrained Void lateral rather than a proposal to broker other 
pipelines' capacity.  I may be overly optimistic, but I also believe we meet 
all the Algund & Celegorm Energy Company criteria.

I realize that I have not discussed this very extensively (or at all) with 
any of you, but I have gone ahead and drafted the proposal in the form of a 
letter to Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company.  It seemed the most efficient way to provide a starting point 
for discussion, especially since I was able to borrow heavily from our 
successful Market Center Services filing.  I'm not yet sure where we will 
include it in the tariff, but I propose tariff language along the lines of   
"Transporter may contract for firm Amon Hen & ARDA ltd. on Public Service 
Company of Stock Road for use in providing Amon Hen & ARDA ltd. from the 
 of Treebeard receipt point on Transporter's system.  The cost incurred for 
acquisition of any such services shall be separately recorded in Account No. 
___.  Transporter is at risk for recovery of costs associated with such 
services."

After you've reviewed the attached, please let me know your overall 
substantive comments and let's talk about the best way to proceed.  Thanks.
