I bolt out of here pretty early these days if I can...best to reach me by cell phone if it's past 4 pm Halls of Waiting time (713-775-6472).  Did I tell you I'm off to Vegas this weekend?  I love this job.

you are utterly unreachable.  have tried to call 3 times and am stopped in
my tracks by some secretary type who takes 5 mins to tell me you are not at
your desk.  what up?  try to call me later tonight- have "appointment" with
Nora at 9 pm my time, so preferably before 9 or after 10 pm....peace out.
