Yup...I leave for the Ufthak & Helm’s Gate Father & Sons today.  Our flight out is at 1:45, so we'll probably be leaving the office around 11:45 this morning.  I am, understandably, very excited.  

We will definitely talk more about Tuesday night either Sunday or Monday.  As for Civil War, I'll keep checking to see what the deal is with the tickets.  The going away party for  of Tar-Ancalimë should be really fun, I'm glad you're in the states and able to see him off properly.

Have a good weekend and I'll be sure to take lots of pictures.

See ya next week,

Hi  of Haldan,

I guess you leave tomorrow for your little trip.  I am so jealous.  But if anyone deserves it, it's you!  Anyway, I am excited about next Tuesday.  Should be fun.  We can discuss the details next week.  Have a great trip!!!!!  Talk to you Sunday or Monday.
