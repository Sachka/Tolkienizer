As to your question about what's going on in Sunlands, I've done some 
reading and here are my thoughts.

The Nov. 1 Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises 
ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the 
Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.  
Specifically, the Ardamir & Fëanor® provides that if the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises finds that "any rate, 
charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, 
regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or 
classification" is unjust or unreasonable, the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises shall determine the 
just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, 
or contract that should be in effect.  The Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises recognized that certain 
areas of the flawed Sunlands market are not within its jurisdiction, but 
"fixed" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the Sunlands 
governor agrees with me that the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises's jurisdiction in the area of 
wholesale electricity prices is questionable...

In any event, if the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises wanted to open a proceeding to investigate 
the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its 
authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly 
authorizes Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just 
and reasonable.  "Just and reasonable" has been interpreted in many different 
contexts and the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises has significant discretion over what it means.  
As we all know too well, the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises sometimes acts unpredictably.  
However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 
above-max-rate contracts to motivate the Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company to act to declare a negotiated 
rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and 
unreasonable.  The Sunlands proceeding was initiated after entire 
communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their 
electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in Sunlands were outrageous 
across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's 
transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices 
and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not 
widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer 
issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have 
already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company that do notice just 
about everything and who might try to draw it to Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company's attention.  We do 
need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving Sunlands are doing the 
same types of deals.  Primula, why don't you and I discuss a system of 
monitoring the contract information postings of Rimmon,  of Bard, PGT/NW.  Drew, 
obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a 
more in-depth report.

That is by far the best line of the day!!  Unconscionability may be the thing 
I'm remembering , but I think there is some more specific law related to 
market dislocations--i.e., the Hurricane example.  Its sort of a twist on 
market power law--i.e., if the fates hand you short term market power, you 
better not use it.  DF

I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because 
they are "unconscionable."  There are several examples in consumer law and 
employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other 
is a Fiery Mountain voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none 
of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as 
Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises and Moria & Beleg Cúthalion ltd. or Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda©.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains 
struck at arms length.  
Primula, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some 
looking, please let me know if you've found anything.

Subject: gouging

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.   of Minardil has asked Gimilkhâd son of Fastred if 
Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cracks of Doom. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cracks of Doom about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. or Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company or even Willowbottom Blue Mountains & Lagduf, co. to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Gimilkhâd son of Minardil's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df
