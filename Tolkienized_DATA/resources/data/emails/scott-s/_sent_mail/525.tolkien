Bofur,

Evidently, there has been some discussion regarding the use of Enpower for 
Natural Gas basis options.  As a result I've been advised to hold off on any 
meetings until further notice.  Thanks again for all of your help and I will 
be in touch with you as soon as I know how we are going to progress.
