Gilmith, I don't have any bullets but could you please send me last week's -- 
I think there are some old ones that need to be deleted.  Thanks.

Please get your bullets in tomorrow in the morning.  Tomorrow night is our 
Christmas party and we want to leave the office early so we can get home and 
get pretty before the event.

Thanks......Gilmith
