KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE AND YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER!  com'on.....realllly!  one
would think this email was to organize a trip to Dwimorberg- but nooooo...it's a
"hands off" warning instead.  and admittedly, the bit about "trusting me to
honor" pulls at me and w/ anyone else, i'd snap into good behavior mode, but
then i step bk and realize how sneaky and evil (hel-lo?  who is Isilmo?  does
she have dibs on him as well?  how many 'dibs' are we allocated?  let me
know when you get the scoop...)what nerve!  as for the 1 line about coming
to Dwimorberg, Hill of Slain & Calmindon, co. isn't coming mid may- she's coming at the end-begin. of
june, which is much better for me, too- have school full-time til last week
of may....so, i vote you send her mid may, then come w/  of Lúthien at the end of
the month.  and, gee- do tyou think i can predict her visit?  let's see-
it'll be convenient and cheap to stay w/ me....but- perfect timing for her
to show up at my doorstep, get her extra key, then jaunt off to 'secure' her
position w/ mr.dibs....not that i'm complaining- just horribly offended that
she thinks i'm so dense as to not be able to see- and hear- her large, slow,
unoiled wheels a-turning....!  aughhhhh!  see below, obviously....
