Hey stranger,

Haven't talked to you in while, how are things going?  The trip was absolutely incredible.  We went scuba diving, swam with stingrays and drank enough (rum for me personally) to drown a large school of fish.  

Anyway, I've decided I'm a no go for Emyn Eglain this Thursday night.  I'm already exhausted and Angelica daughter of Eönwë offered to drive Friday morning so I've decided to take her up on the offer.  After the Bucklebury Ford & Anduin, Ethir Father & Sons last weekend,  of Niënor's wedding this weekend and Causeway, in Gondor next weekend I've decided my best move is to try and conserve some energy.  Regardless, I will see you and Faramir Saturday night and we'll do our catching up then.  My parents are coming to the wedding as well so I'm sure they'll want to have a nice chat with you and Faramir.

Talk to you soon,
 of Éothain

Hope Law Review isn't wearing you too thin.
