Em,

I cannot believe you ran into Anardil son of Arathorn!!!  I'm sure it's just the first of 
many celebrity sightings you will have in Jolly Old Westfold Vale.  I had an 
absolutely incredible time in Causeway, in Gondor with  of Gróin.  We went to the beach 
(where I was able to lay-out and not sweat!), shopped a ton, attended the 
symphony and got messages.  All in all it was an extremely relaxing weekend.  
Yesterday, I was in Emyn Eglain for a recruiting trip and got to see  of Angelimar's new 
house in Ninglor - very cute.  

So I got back to work today, Wednesday, and still no word from Grimbeorn son of Telemnar.  
Just to refresh, the last time I heard from him (email) was Thursday 
morning.  You'd be proud of me though as I have refrained from any form of 
contact and plan to continue that route only deviating if/when it becomes 
necessary for me to have a formal close to things.  I'm still hoping that 
will not be the case but am fully prepared for the possibility that my brief 
encounter with dating may be over for a while.

Sue
