Also, there was a confirm that came in Friday with Esmeralda Brandybuck & Amon Rûdh Energy Company for you Buying 
1/day  BOM (12/2-12/31) HeHub Gas Daily $7.00 Call Option at $0.26.  The 
counterparty was Rhovanion & Last Mountain Deliveries...Let me know if this is a good trade and we'll get 
it loaded into the system.
