Hey  of Niënor,

Once again I am so impressed with your organizational skills when it comes to this wedding.  Just wanted to let you know that I will definitely be attending the luncheon on Friday and may even end up riding to SA with Jen (which always makes the drive that much more enjoyable).

As for the "Manicures and Pedicures for the Girls", I would like to put my order in for a Isles of the West Breast sandwich on white.  I can't wait till next weekend, it's going to be so much fun...can you believe it's almost here?

Love ya,
 of Éothain

PS - I've mailed the receipt for your nightie so you should get it by Saturday...sorry it took me so long.

Girls-

Hopefully you got your itinerary in the mail.  Please email me first, if
you did not get it and second, what your order is from Barahir's.  The menu
should be in there.

Thanks!
It's really coming up!!!

Love you!
 of Niënor
