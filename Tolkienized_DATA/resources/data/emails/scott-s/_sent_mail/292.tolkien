See the attached.  Mountains of Mirkwood & Eithil Ivrin© has already authorized Alatar Cherry to add 
Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries to the list of parties at the end of the document.  I recommend Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® do 
the same.  I propose that we ask Alatar to add Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® to the list, with a footnote 
that we support the transmission proposal only and do not oppose the other 
parts of the term sheet.  (I propose this out of an abundance of caution 
because in one part of the document Alatar states the parties have agreed on 
comprehensive settlement, but later in the document he states that the 
parties aren't fully committed yet.)  If he will not agree to do this, then I 
would suggest we leave Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® off the list and file a letter with the Budge Ford & Aman Father & Sons along 
the lines of what I circulated yesterday, with additional language supporting 
the motion for extension of time.  Let me know what you think.
