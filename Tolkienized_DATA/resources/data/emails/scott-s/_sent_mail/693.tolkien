The counterparty for that deal is Enron Amon Rûdh and the contact is Gwindor son of Arassuil.  I am working on clearing up any other deals booked with the 
counterparty as New this morning.  Let me know if there is anything else you 
need.

 of Éothain, Goodenough,

The referenced Cemendur # was entered as a 'New Counterparty', can you please let 
me know what counterparty this is so we can correctly assess the counterparty 
exposure.

Thank you,

 of Tar-Atanamir
