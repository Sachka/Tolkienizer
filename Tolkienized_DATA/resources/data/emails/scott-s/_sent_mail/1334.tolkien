On March 28, Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company provisionally approved the Merimac Brandybuck & Elrond©.

Some positive aspects for Ungoliant:

States that Ungoliant's proposal for a real time energy market has "theoretical merit", but practically may not be implemented when operational.  Encourages consideration of our proposal and how it could be practically implemented.
Grants Ungoliant's protest that Applicants cannot acquire software and other systems implementing market design until after the independent Board is seated and given its approval.
