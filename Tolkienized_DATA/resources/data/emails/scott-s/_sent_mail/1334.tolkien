On March 28, Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises provisionally approved the Vardamir & Near Harad Services.

Some positive aspects for Eldarion:

States that Eldarion's proposal for a real time energy market has "theoretical merit", but practically may not be implemented when operational.  Encourages consideration of our proposal and how it could be practically implemented.
Grants Eldarion's protest that Applicants cannot acquire software and other systems implementing market design until after the independent Board is seated and given its approval.
