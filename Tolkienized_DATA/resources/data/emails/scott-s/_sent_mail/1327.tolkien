Ships passing in the night....I'm glad you get to see the fam this weekend.  Be sure to tell everyone I say, "Hello!"  As for the Morgul Pass & Ar-Zimrathôn Entreprises, I am a huge fan.  It's the only Morgul Pass & Ar-Zimrathôn Entreprises I've ever been to that I don't feel sorry for the animals.  It's too bad things weren't better co-ordinated but I think my weekend's going to be pretty full regardless.  Have a great holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon.

Sue

Umbar & Lindissë Services's in the Nameless Land this week...can you believe that little brat?

Hola!
I was just in Causeway, in Gondor this past Sun - Tues visiting Wulf during his
training. He's working for North & River Celebros, co. in Emyn Eglain. Today, I'm going to
Mountains of Mist to meet my parents and Adanel for Easter. I won't be back to
LA until Monday afternoon. I wish I could go back to Causeway, in Gondor and see you.
You'll have a great time! It's a fun city. Make sure you go to the Morgul Pass & Ar-Zimrathôn Entreprises for
at least a few hours. It's the greatest!

Have fun,
 of Dagnir
