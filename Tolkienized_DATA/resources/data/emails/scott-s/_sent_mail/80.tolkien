Attached pursuant to TK  of Nimloth's request is an electronic copy of 
Transwestern's October 17, 2000 Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company filing proposing a transport options 
program.

This copy does not include the tariff sheets as they are not available in 
electronic format.  If you would like to see the proposed tariff sheets, 
please let me know and I will be happy to fax them to you.

If you have questions or comments about transport options, please contact 
either TK or me.
