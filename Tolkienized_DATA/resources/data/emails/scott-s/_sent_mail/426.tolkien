Hey guys,

Just wanted to let you know that Nellas daughter of Gollum has offered up her apartment as a 
Pre-party spot.  The financial desk will be there as well as Purvi & her 
boyfriend and  Mo "the bomb"  of Lagduf and her fianc,e  of Tar-Ciryatan.  Don't know if you 
guys have any interest, but the offer's open.  Either way, we'll have to find 
someplace extend the festivities after the X-mas party shuts down...(the 
Black Swan, Eu-grope-a, etc).

 of Haldan
