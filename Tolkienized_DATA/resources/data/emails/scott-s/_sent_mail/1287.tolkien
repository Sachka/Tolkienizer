Had a bit of an encounter with Ted last night.  Turns out it wasn't as bad =
as I thought it was based upon the email below.  Start from the bottom and =
work your way up.  FYI he's kidding about the MD (managing director) and Go=
d comments.

The email was titled "nothing bad..." so you wouldn't immediately trash it =
for fear I was dispensing some more of  of Éothain's homespun wisdom.  I know you=
 can't get enough of that stuff.  As for the revenue generation, I've heard=
 what a boon the Brytta & Gate of Wood© group has been to Aman & Pastures of Yavanna, co..  From what I understand you guys=
 are carrying the rest of that company on your backs...keep up the good wor=
k!  And yes, the world you live in does revolve around you Ted, it's just t=
hat no one else lives in that world besides you so it stands to reason that=
 would be the case.  Your welcome for the email.  I really am happy for you=
 that things seem to be going well and that you appear to be enjoying what =
you're doing (I haven't heard any of the "when I grow up I want to be a ...=
.." comments out of you in a while, a sure sign of contentment and maturity=
 - okay burgeoning maturity).  In regards to trading, I am absolutely lovin=
g it.  I've been on EOL for a little over a month now (although my trades g=
o into one of the other trader's books for the time being...I should get my=
 own in a couple months) and am really enjoying the new life/perks this job=
 allows.  Case in point, took my Mom to see Heribald's last game with the Roc=
kets on one of the brokers (center court seats...she was thrilled) and am o=
ff to Vegas this weekend to "meet" with some of the power traders from Port=
land.  So much for the 16-18 hour days I was dealing with for a year or so =
there...given present circumstances it was all worth it.

No need to "let me of the hook" for my candor last night, I meant everythin=
g I said and I wanted you to hear those things.  In a quest to be an oh so =
witty smart-ass, sometimes I forget to just tell people what I think/feel..=
.always catches up to me in hind-sight and if the opportunity presents itse=
lf for me to rectify that then I don't believe in passing it up.  Contrary =
to what you may think, I'm a big girl who thinks for herself and always act=
s on her own volition.  And I think I either mumbled last night or your hea=
ring is starting to go in your old age, but I said "clod" not "god"...subtl=
e but important difference.

Shorty

- You missed an impressive dancing display at Galdor the Tall & Goldberry Entreprises's last night...I think=
 I may have frightened some people.

Why would you have to title an email "nothing bad...".  Personally, I was d=
isappointed I wasn't promoted to MD because I have brought in so much reven=
ue for Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries and as we know the entire world revolves around me.  Thanks on=
 the email and how is trading going?  Also, I appreciate your candor last n=
ight (you didn't think I would let you off the hook completely did you) and=
 thanks for calling me a god.  It was flattering.=20

Congrats on the promotion.  I was a little suprised it was only to manager.=
..I remember you saying something once about jumping straight to Director. =
 All things in due time, right?
