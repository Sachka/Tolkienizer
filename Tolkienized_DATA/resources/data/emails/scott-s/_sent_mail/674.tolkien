Hey Beregar,

I haven't forgotten that I still owe you a birthday beer.  In fact, Tar-Calmacil was 
kind enough to point out my failure to do so and add to my already heavy 
feelings of guilt.  Anyway, I know you guys are working hard getting your 
presentation ready, but if you need a break I'm planning on meeting a friend 
at Thorondir's tonight for a little pizza and beer.  Let me know if you have 
any interest in collecting...if not, you can just hold on to your raincheck 
until another time.

 of Éothain
