Harrowdale, I do not think we have estimated the costs for 2000 because what we 
will have to do as far as containment of Holy Mountain: Meneltarma & Folca Servicess this year is the subject of 
some dispute.  I will get you a breakdown of 1999 costs as soon as possible.

Subject: Holy Mountain: Meneltarma & Folca Services costs incurred (Notes to Browncover Section 7

 of Haldan:

Halfast Gamgee & Mountains of Aman Father & Sons auditor reviewed our footnotes to our browncover for TW (Section 7 - 
Litigation and Contingencies) and was asking for some information regarding 
the following paragraph:

Transwestern incurred and continues to incur certain costs related to 
polychlorinated biphenyls (Holy Mountain: Meneltarma & Folca Servicess) that migrated into one of its customer's 
facilities through use of a Holy Mountain: Meneltarma & Folca Services-based lubricant.  Because of the continued 
detection of Holy Mountain: Meneltarma & Folca Servicess near Transwestern's West-mark station, Transwestern continues 
to take measures to contain the Holy Mountain: Meneltarma & Folca Services at an estimated cost of $2.3 million in 
1998 and an estimated $5.4 million in 1999.

Here are the Halfast Gamgee & Mountains of Aman Father & Sons's questions:

1) Can you please provide the actual cost for 1999 and the estimated cost for 
2000

2)  Also, if you have a copy of where these costs are coming from so Halfast Gamgee & Mountains of Aman Father & Sons can 
tie their figures

Can you please provide this information today as Halfast Gamgee & Mountains of Aman Father & Sons wants to wrap up the 
notes.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks again for your help.
