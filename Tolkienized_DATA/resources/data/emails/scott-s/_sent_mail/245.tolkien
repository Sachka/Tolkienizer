P.S. -- Arador, on your wish list you had included an evergreen provision.  See 
Section 2 of the original contract, which gives Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises the right to extend for 
another five-year term by giving notice to Blanco Bracegirdle & Hidden City, co..  If Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises does not give such 
notice, Blanco Bracegirdle & Hidden City, co. may cancel the contract, and if it doesn't, the contract 
automatically rolls over for another year.  If this is not acceptable please 
let me know.

Rich and Arador, attached are my suggested revisions to Gimilkhâd McLeod's draft of 
an amendment to the Naith & Caverns of Narog Energy Company agreement.  Arador, I'll bring 
you a copy of that agreement.  Rich, if Gimilkhâd did not send you one, let me 
know and I will fax it to you.  

In my revisions, I've attempted to reflect the least cost billing you 
described to me, using terminology I read in the tariff.  Please let me know 
if it looks alright to you.  I'm available to discuss this whenever you are, 
then I will make sending this to Gimilkhâd top priority.  My sincerest apologies 
for the delay; there has been more chaos around here than I am accustomed to 
handling, and I appreciate your patience.
