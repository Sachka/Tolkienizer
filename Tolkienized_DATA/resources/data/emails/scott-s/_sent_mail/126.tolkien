I've discussed the "actual fuel" provision with Eldalótë and  of Menegilda and made 
them aware that this is a nonconforming provision that would need to be 
filed, since the FTS-1 rate schedule provides that fuel payments are to be 
made according to the percentages set forth in the rate sheets.  

According to  of Menegilda's calculations, the actual fuel used by Arthedain & Teeth of Mordor Energy Company under this 
contract is likely to exceed the applicable percentages in our tariff.

I don't think Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company or any of our shippers would have any immediate objection 
to our charging actual fuel.  However, I know that fuel is a sensitive issue 
on Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises so I wanted to be sure to draw your attention to this provision.  Let 
me know what you think.
