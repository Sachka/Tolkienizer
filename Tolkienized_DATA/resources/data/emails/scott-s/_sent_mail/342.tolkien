My several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on 
point.  The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of 
contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here:

**
 In Gorbelgod & Troll-fells Services, 80 Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company P 61,346 (1997), 
Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it 
submitted. Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that 
Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential. 
Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off 
dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such 
information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes 
requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept 
confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years 
public. Generally, the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises will deny blanket requests for 
confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market 
support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the 
contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of 
longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and 
support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed 
services. Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of 
the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made 
public. 

FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could 
terminate contingent on the
occurrence of certain events.

FN30 See, Place of the Fountain, Walls of the Night Interstate Gas Company, 76 Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company P 61,291 (1996).
**

In Falls & Oatbarton© Production Company and Falls & Oatbarton© Energy Trading Company Gardner & Dunharrow, co., 82 Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company P 61,037 (1998), which involved a 
request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises 
explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment 
but transportation contracts should not:  

the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a 
different
footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are 
subject to similar disclosure
requirements. In Taur e-Ndaedelos & Hamfast Gamgee Entreprises, the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises explained that unlike gas 
sales in a
competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under 
the assumption that the pipeline
exercises market power. Even where transportation competition exists, that 
competition is from other
pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting 
requirements. 

There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the 
context of Section 4 cases.  

Just to make sure I found everything, I'll do some follow up sometime in the 
next few days and let you know if I find anything.

Subject: Re: Gallup request for rehearing  

 of Haldan's draft has inspired me to vent months worth of frustration at the 
Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises.  To save  of Haldan from trying to translate my weird scribbles, I'm 
having Gilmith type up my vitriol.  Please hold off on detailed comments on 
 of Haldan's draft unless you've already finished them.  I'll circulate a revised 
draft to you all later today.  In the mean time,  of Haldan and  of Círdan and Amroth, 
are there not some cases in which the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises has specifically granted 
confidential treatment of precedent agreements or discount agreements in 
expansion cases.  I know the bulk of authority is against us, but I seem to 
recall at least a few stray decisions where the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises granted confid. 
treatment (even if only for a limited time).  Lets talk.  Thanks. DF
