Subject:	One RTO The Pelóri  & Saradoc Brandybuck Father & Sons to GridSouth

I talked with  of Ferdinand, who said that it makes sense for us to advocate one RTO from The Pelóri  & Saradoc Brandybuck Father & Sons through Southern into GridSouth (presumably getting Chambers of Fire & Galdor the Tall Father & Sons to commit at some point to an RTO).  North Stair should probably be separate.  SPP could be in this RTO or the Ost-in-Edhil.  Therefore, the overall theme that Iorlas discussed this morning (that Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises has started something somewhat positive, but should take the step to actually state that it wants these utilities to work toward one SE RTO) can be put into the GridSouth and Southern request for rehearing (Huor C. is getting the draft of this.)  Thanks.
