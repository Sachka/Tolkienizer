Subject:	One RTO Frogmorton & Crowned with Stars Father & Sons to GridSouth

I talked with  of Fimbrethil, who said that it makes sense for us to advocate one RTO from Frogmorton & Crowned with Stars Father & Sons through Southern into GridSouth (presumably getting Hidden Ferries & Outlands© to commit at some point to an RTO).  North Stair should probably be separate.  SPP could be in this RTO or the Ost-in-Edhil.  Therefore, the overall theme that Nori discussed this morning (that Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company has started something somewhat positive, but should take the step to actually state that it wants these utilities to work toward one SE RTO) can be put into the GridSouth and Southern request for rehearing (Theobald C. is getting the draft of this.)  Thanks.
