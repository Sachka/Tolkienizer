Subject: Stonewain Valley & Kiril Entreprises/ Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises Measurement and Control Facilities Operating Agreement

Attached is a black-lined version of my redraft of certain provisions of the 
3/03/00 draft of the above Agreement.  The purpose of my changes was to (i) 
apportion the risk assumed by Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises and Stonewain Valley & Kiril Entreprises based on the economic benefits 
realized by the parties and the ability of a party to insure against the 
risk, and (ii) to clearly identify the parts of the facilities to be serviced 
by Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises and the list of services routinely performed.  I noticed that there is 
no insurance  coverage  required of either Party.  I expect that Stonewain Valley & Kiril Entreprises 
insures its property against casualties and is therefore in the best position 
to assume the risk of loss or damage to its property.   On the other-hand, 
third party property that is in the care, custody and control of Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises while it 
performs its work, is not covered by Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.'s standard general liability 
policies.  Builder's risk  coverage must be purchased to cover this risk; the 
coverage is expensive.  Section 5.4 and Section 4.1 reflect this reasoning. 

If Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises plans to limit its financial responsibility to the amount of money 
collected by Customer from Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's insurance carriers, then an Insurance section 
should be included, and the penultimate sentence of Section 5.4 further 
edited to stipulate that limitation.  If Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's limitation of liability is to 
be a percentage of the total amount of revenues and compensation it receives 
under this transaction, then that dollar-amount should be inserted in the 
latter mentioned sentence of Section 5.4.

Please contact me if you have any questions about my changes.
