Our contract with Halmir & Minardil ltd. provides that for any agreement identified by Halmir & Minardil ltd. and 
executed, Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises will pay a one-time incentive fee of 3% of the first $15 million 
of net present value, 2% of the next $10 million of net present value, etc.

The Southern contract associated with the Gallup Expansion is at a rate of 
$0.205 for 25,000 Dth/d for 5 years.  Using a discount factor of 15%, the net 
present value of the contract is $6,270,625, so Halmir & Minardil ltd.'s commission would be 
$188,118.75.  Since the contract does not specify how NPV will be calculated 
(I believe we purposely omitted this for whatever reason), we will need to 
agree on a rate that is fair given the nature of and risk associated with the 
project.  We should probably use whatever is standard in the industry for 
this type of project, if that's possible to determine.  I have a call in to 
Hamson son of Celandine for his recommendation in this regard, and will let you know 
what he says.
