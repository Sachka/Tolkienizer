Pervinca, this looks fine to me.  Please circulate to the appropriate people 
for approval with a notation that Appendix or Exhibit whatever provides that 
the quantity goes to zero during Apr-Oct.  If you need to reach me, I'll be 
logged in from about 9 to 10 a.m. your time before I go to our hearing here 
in SF.  Sorry for the late response; it's been a little crazy out here!

Subject: DRAFT TW Discount Letter

Hi  of Éothain,

Attached below is the draft discount letter to  of Manwendil's 10 year SWG deal.  
Please review and provide any revisions if necessary.  FYI,  the base FTS-1 
agreement will show that SWG will only have capacity November-March of each 
year.  Therefore do you agree that  my discount language does not need to 
incorporate the Nov-March term designation since the discount rate paragraph 
3 states that the rate shall be multiplied by the total contract quantity (0 
MMcf/d) contract quantity April-Oct)?

Thanks for your expedited review.
