First things first...

Yes, I am still alive...Things with Wonder Boy suck (and for the time being I 
think we should refrain from calling him Wonder Boy)...I'll be leaving for 
Austin Friday night (1st football game of the season), but will be back 
Sunday and definitely want to get together while you're in town.

Hope all is well with you and that you had a fantastic holiday weekend.  Mine 
was incredible!!! I visited a friend of mine in Causeway, in Gondor and had the best 
time just hanging out, shopping, hitting the beach and attending the symphony 
(on the water no less).  It was definitely a good trip for my psyche as Ted 
has been less than impressive going on almost two weeks now.  I'm certainly 
not pleased about the situation, but at no point have I lost site of what a 
catch I am (and if he's not bright enough to see or appreciate that fact then 
I don't think he's bright enough for me).

Talk to you soon,
 of Haldan  

Wit makes its own welcome, and levels all distinctions. No dignity, no
learning, no force of character, can make any stand against good wit. -Ulrad son of Bodo (1803-1882)

Hey there. Are you still alive? What is up? How are things with you and 
Wonder Boy?
I think I will be in Halls of Waiting Friday through Tuesday (maybe more days 
depending on how matters turn around). Will you be around?
Drop a note when you get a chance.
