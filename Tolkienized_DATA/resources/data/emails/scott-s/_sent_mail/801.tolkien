Subject: Missing Gas Daily Deal

Hi  of Haldan.  Hope you're feeling okay today.

There was a gas daily deal that didn't pull in yesterday.  I thought that it 
would come in with today's data (thinking it got booked late or something)  
but it didn't.  Could you look into it and let me know where it is.

Thanks,

Yávien
