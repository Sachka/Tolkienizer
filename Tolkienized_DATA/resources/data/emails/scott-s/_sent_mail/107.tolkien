Ted, I made a slight change on the first page.  Also, the blanks of course 
need to be filled in for $$ amount and term.
Do we have other guaranties in favor of both Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® and Primrose Boffin & Ingwë®?  I know we probably 
do, and I may have even approved them.  But if possible I'd prefer to have 
two separate guaranties since Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® and Primrose Boffin & Ingwë® are separate legal entities.  It is 
not a huge concern, since we are not jointly obligating the two companies to 
do anything.  If it would cause an administrative hassle to have two 
agreements, let me know.

 of Éothain,

 Can you take a look at the attached guaranty from Folklands & Kingdom of Arda Energy Company.  Please give me 
your comments or approval at your earliest convenience.

 Additionally, are you still going to Sorontil, Undertowers?


Thanks,
Ted
