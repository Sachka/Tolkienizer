Turns out my boss is going to get to River Poros & Algund Deliveries's at @ 5:00.  So if you want to 
show up earlier, say 6:00/6:30, I'm sure that would be cool.  I know Sigismond, 
Aranarth and possibly Lugdush are planning on going so you may want to see when 
they are planning on getting there.
