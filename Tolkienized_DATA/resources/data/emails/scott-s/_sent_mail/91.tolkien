That is correct, I returned comments to Accounting, not AA directly.
I don't think I sent my comments to Drew, but I don't remember very clearly.

 of Éothain,

That is pretty much all we needed for now  of Éothain.  I appreciate your offer of 
the comments, but I will get back to you later if it looks like we need to 
see those.  

You mentioned you sent comments to someone at AA.  I assume you mean the 
comments were returned to the Primrose Boffin & Ingwë® and Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® accounting folks instead (where 
Roper is).  Also, do you send your comments to Drew as well.  

Thanks for the quick response.

I reviewed the 1999 Form 2 for Transwestern and sent some comments to someone 
at AA (I apologize, I don't remember who, but I think it might have been 
Roper Joe).
If you need to see my comments, I believe I kept a hard copy in my file.

I also reviewed the 1998 Form 2 for Transwestern.

If you need further information, please let me know.

Subject: 1999 Form No. 2 Review - Legal

 of Belegorn/ of Éothain,

My name is Radbug son of Bosco with Merimac son of Hallas, and I am the experienced staff 
on the Elfinesse & Standelf Services (with a focus on Primrose Boffin & Ingwë® and Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®) audit 
team.  Right now, we are in the midst of several internal control reviews 
related to various risk areas. 

We are currently testing the risk that Primrose Boffin & Ingwë® and Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® reserves (regulatory, legal 
contingencies, etc.) are inappropriately valued and/or established.  One of 
the controls that Accounting cited to mitigate this risk was that both Legal 
and Rates reviewed the Primrose Boffin & Ingwë® and Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® FERC Form No. 2s prior to issuance.   of Tindómiel 
Walters and Roper Joe mentioned to us that there is no formal "sign-off" or 
approval process by Legal and Rates of the Form 2s, but instead, drafts were 
sent to the groups and any comments were then reviewed with Accounting.  Your 
names were mentioned as those they sent the 1999 Form 2 drafts to for Legal 
to review ( of Belegorn-Primrose Boffin & Ingwë® and  of Éothain-Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®).   

In order for us to test this control, we need to confirm with your group that 
this type of review was performed for the 1999 Primrose Boffin & Ingwë® and Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® Form No. 2s.  What 
role did you and your group play in this review?

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your time.

Tony - AA
