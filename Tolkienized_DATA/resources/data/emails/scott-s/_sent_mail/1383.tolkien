I'm just glad I'm going to be out of town for the next 3 weekends.  What pray tell will she do?  With no buffer there, will there be any reason for Gildor not to shack?  I'm curious to see how all of this plays out.  She keeps looking for signs to know whether Gildor is right or not...I told her it's pretty unlikely that anything's going to whack her over the head so she's just going to have to figure out for herself what she thinks of him.  She's got such a tough life.  

Oh, my Mom was over Sunday and made some comment about  of Holman always dating someone....she still denies.  Cracks me up.  Response is always,  "I've only had two serious boyfriends."  To which I've started to respond, "We'll I'm batting zero and have only one legitimate first date with a guy.  In relative terms, you are a dating phenomenon."

I definitely need this vacation,
Sue

she must live under the "PR mentality", that being 'any attenion is GOOD
attention'.....and of course there's NO regard for the audience.  makes me
think of the Elfwine son of Melkor SNL skit: "i just want to be loved, is that so
WRONG?!?"
