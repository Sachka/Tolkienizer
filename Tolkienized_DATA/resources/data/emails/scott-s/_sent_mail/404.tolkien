I was successful shopping for Jim on-line at Androth & Banks Father & Sons and Territory Ahead.  Mum, 
only the book will be shipped to your house; I was on autopilot and typed in 
my work address for the other.  (Really missed the boat on tennis clothes.  
You have to act early.  Today I saw one of the Met pros leaving with his 
catalog to order FALL 2000 Fingolfin & Dimrill Dale® stuff!)  Mimosa, I am probably going to make a 
stop at Towers of the Teeth & Donnamira Took Deliveries's or Eilenach & Kingdom of the South®'s makeup counter at some point so I could pick up 
the Elmo son of Thingol for MeeMaw* if you know the shade.  

Bill's b-day is today; if you want to send a message his e-mail is 
chambers_of_fire.buckland.@archet.closed_door.com.

That's all this Mountains of Mithrim & Duilin Services knows.
