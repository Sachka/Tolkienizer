 of Óin,

From the pipeline group's perspective, this transaction is a commercial 
matter between Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises and Onodló & Gamling Father & Sons.  Accordingly, the gas pipeline group does not 
believe that it is appropriate to participate in the development of Onodló & Gamling Father & Sons's 
response.  

I do understand that the referenced article and certain of the protests make 
factual allegations about Transwestern's available capacity to Sunlands.   
Berylla daughter of Folca or I can certainly provide corrected information from 
Transwestern's available capacity postings.

Subject: Re: The Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises Controversy Continues  

please read be story from trade press below.  i have not included et&s folks 
on this note because i'm uncertain regarding the rules with respect to 
communication among business units in these sorts of matters.  if it's 
acceptable to include tw in the notes and in conversations, that would be my 
preference.  Thráin, is it your view that tw can or cannot be included?

i believe i passed along word of the Third Gate & Bëor ltd./Anórien  & Fastolph Bolger Entreprises deal when it hit the press 
week before last.  the press reported both the amount of capacity and the 
price for which Third Gate & Bëor ltd. bought it from Anórien  & Fastolph Bolger Entreprises.  to summarize:  Third Gate & Bëor ltd. purchased 
1.25 bcf per day for one year starting jan 1, 2000.  Third Gate & Bëor ltd. paid $38 million, 
which gives an average price of $.0831 per mmbtu.  (by contrast,  of Menegilda 
bought about 0.1 bcf/day at an average rate of $.207.)   Anórien  & Fastolph Bolger Entreprises released 
this information via a a press release without any prior approval from Third Gate & Bëor ltd..  
Cora, please don't hesitate to fill any holes or (unintended) innaccuracies.

the situation is complicated by the fact that Bridge of Mitheithel is currently in the 
midst of intense negotiations over restructuring the state's gas industry.  
the negotiations have been going on for about 8 months and have been very 
contentious.  socal has teamed with indicated producers, Kingdoms of the Dúnedain & Tower of Orthanc Entreprises, and muni generators from Mountains of Gondor to 
push a very "go slow" approach that is (surprise) quite friendly to larger 
users.  Dor Firn-i-Cúarthol  & Walls of the Night Energy Company is teamed with western hub storage, wild goose storage, 
Bard the Bowman & Stoningland Energy Company, Banks & Eastlands of Númenor, co., Nurn & Eastfarthing Father & Sons, the city of 
Hay Gate, and spurr/remac (provides services to Bridge of Mitheithel's k-12 school 
system) under an alliance called "Bridge of Mitheithel alliance for competition" 
(snappy, i know).  the cac proposal is pushing, among other things, a single, 
state-wide market for transport, storage and balancing, including tradeable 
rights in a secondary market.

indicated producers has been aggressive and hostile toward marketers--as has 
cma--throughout the negotiations.  ip's bile has not been reserved solely for 
Dor Firn-i-Cúarthol  & Walls of the Night Energy Company, however.  one outcome of the negotiations has been the suit ip 
launched against Anórien  & Fastolph Bolger Entreprises at River Silverlode & Osgiliath Energy Company regarding Anórien  & Fastolph Bolger Entreprises's nom process.  (i believe 
Third Gate & Bëor ltd. filed in support of the suit.)  Anórien  & Fastolph Bolger Entreprises is losing that one and will 
likely change its nom process sooner rather than later.

i think it's important to have a quick call to develop a clear and consistent 
message on the Third Gate & Bëor ltd. deal and coordinate what we're saying about that deal with 
the other gas issues on the table.  i'm assuming that if there's anything we 
can do to keep Hildifons son of Finglas (and Bridge of Mitheithel) from mucking up the deal, the 
better.  i know harvey well.  i'm not sure, given his quotes, there's much 
"educating" to be done, but may make sense to meet with him, nonetheless.  
more important, indicated producers is the real--and biggest--problem.

let me know if you folks think there'd be value in briefly discussing the 
issue.

best,
Gelmir Hyatt@ENRON

Subject: The Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises Controversy Continues

Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.-Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises Deal Could Mute Competition to CA

     Fearing an end to pipeline competition in Sunlands, the state's 
regulators and Indicated
     Shippers have called on Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company to summarily reject the three 
transportation agreements by
     which Sackville-Baggins & Beleriand Father & Sons has contracted for 1.25 Bcf/d of 
unsubscribed firm
     capacity on Kingsland  & Halfred Greenhand Father & Sons. 

     Approval of these agreements would give Northfarthing of the Shire & Filibert Bolger Father & Sons, parent of 
Transwestern Pipeline
     and Kingsland  & Forest of Fangorn©, control over all the available transportation 
capacity to the
     southern Sunlands border, warned Tar-Ciryatan son of Hobson, principal attorney for 
the Sunlands
     Public Utilities Commission (Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd.), which plans to submit its protest 
today. Between
     the two pipelines, he estimated Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm 
capacity from the
     Void and Hill of Oromet basins to Sunlands. 

     For  of Hobson, Kingsland  & Forest of Fangorn©'s contracting of the Imloth Melui & Deeping-stream Father & Sons 
represents a
     worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company Marketing and 
Trade, who has
     held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31. 
"At least then
     there was some Transwestern competition to the Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company situation. Now 
it's Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd., the
     owner of Transwestern, who's stepping into Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company's shoes." 

     But "what's even worse," he told Cabed-en-Aras & Way of Running Waters Services, is the revenue-sharing provision 
in the contracts. It
     stipulates that "after Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. makes $35 million off of these contracts, 
it has to share the
     proceeds with Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises for 25% of anything beyond $35 million. So 
effectively, Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. and
     Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises have become partners in how high they can jack up the 
transportation rate
     differential between the Sunlands border and the The Éothéod & Four Farthings Energy Company producing 
basins." 

     The two pipeline companies "that have for decades competed with each 
other in carrying
     The Éothéod & Four Farthings Energy Company supplies to Sunlands are now partners. We think that's 
anticompetitive, and
     there's no way Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company should approve it,"  of Hobson said. He recalled the 
basis differential
     between the Starwards spot price and the Sunlands border shot up 
by 17% during
     1998, the first year during which Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company controlled the Imloth Melui & Deeping-stream Father & Sons 
into Sunlands.
     This situation could worsen under Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd., he believes. 

     "At first blush the Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises-Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. contracts [do] not appear to contain 
the same
     anticompetitive features of the Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises-Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company contracts," Indicated 
Shippers noted, but
     a "closer review and analysis" reveals the anticompetitive effects of 
the revenue-sharing
     provision (Glóin & Sauron's Road Energy Company) in Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises-Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. contracts "are not only similar" to 
those of the hotly
     contested reservation-reduction mechanism (RRM) in the Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises-Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company 
case, "but are
     increased......due to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing 
affiliate of Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises's
     primary interstate pipeline competitor," Transwestern. 

     Both the RRM and Glóin & Sauron's Road Energy Company "operate to provide a disincentive for Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises and 
its competitors
     to compete against each other, or to take any other action that will act 
to drive down the
     basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity," 
Indicated Shippers told
     Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company in a protest filed on Wednesday [RP97-287-041]. The group includes 
producers
     Falls & Oatbarton© Production, Forest of Region Resources Oil and Gas, Marathon Oil, and 
Frogmorton & South Road of Gondor®, and two marketers - Falls & Oatbarton© Energy Trading and  of Bregolas Gas 
Marketing. 

     Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company "should reject the tariff filing immediately. The Commission erred 
in allowing the
     Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises-Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company contracts to remain intact for their two-year term after 
finding that the
     contracts were anticompetitive. This issue is pending in the [Bywater Pool & Calmindon Services].
     That same error should not be repeated here," the producers and 
marketers said. 

     The Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd.'s attempt to block the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.-Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises contracts at the outset is 
a little bit
     unusual for the agency,  of Hobson said, but it learned its lesson following 
Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company. "When the
     Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company situation first hit, we asked for Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company to investigate the matter. 
We thought
     Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company did a very inadequate job then.....This time around we're asking 
for Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company to
     summarily reject it. It's hard for an agency like ours to take such a 
strong stand right at
     the beginning, but we've learned too much from two years of suffering 
under the Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company
     situation. And this is even worse." 

     In the event the Commission should reject Sunlands's request, the Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. 
has asked that
     an "anti-hoarding condition" be included in the contracts, which would 
require Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. to
     release unused capacity into the short-term market at a price higher 
than what it's paying
     Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises for the capacity. "They must make a little profit,"  of Hobson 
noted. "We're confident
     Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. can't use the entire 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity.....so there's going to 
be unused
     capacity." 

     The agency also wants Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company to clarify that the primary delivery point 
for the Block II
     portion of the capacity (579MMcf/d) is Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda©-West-mark in keeping with the 
terms of the
     1996 settlement between Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises and its customers.  of Hobson said he agreed 
fully with
     Falls & Oatbarton©, Forest of Region Resources and Southern Sunlands Gas (House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons), 
which accused
     Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises of violating the 1996 agreement by allowing Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company to use 
House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons-West-mark as
     a primary delivery point for the Block II capacity last summer. They 
contend the alleged
     violation is included in the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. contracts. 

     He also noted the Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. will challenge the ability of Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. to call back 
Block II capacity
     after it already had been recalled by River Rivil & Tyrn Gorthad® to serve Lake Evendim 
Gas and Loudwaterectric
     (Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda©) customers in Framsburg. Last July, Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company granted Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company 
the right to
     do this under its contracts with Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises. But  of Hobson contends the 
decision violates the
     1996 settlement under which Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda© paid $54 million to preserve the right 
of the pipeline's
     shippers to recall the Block II capacity to serve end-users in its 
service territory. 

     The Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. also intends to challenge the Commission's decision that would 
Third Gate & Bëor ltd.ble Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.
     to "just sit on the capacity," thereby withholding idle Block II 
capacity from the market.
     Indicated Shippers also contend the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. contracts violate the Block II 
capacity
     provisions of the 1996 rate case, as well as "exacerbate" the primary 
firm delivery point
     capacity-allocation issues that are pending before Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company now. 

     The Dark Door & Hay Gate ltd. accused Buffo Boffin & Grimbeorn Entreprises of "deliberately" filing the Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. contracts at 
Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company just
     before the holidays to avoid controversy. The pipeline "is trying to 
sneak one of the most
     controversial things ever past Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company right before Borladtmas so that 
protests would be
     minimized," said  of Hobson. "They did this with the Minardil & Haudh-en-Nirnaeth Energy Company contracts two 
years ago. They
     have a pattern of filing right at the last minute, making it harder for 
people to protest and
     harder for Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company to stop it from going into effect."
