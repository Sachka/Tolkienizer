Dina daughter of Shadowfax and Drew, please see Eldalótë's message below.  This language is 
very similar to language that Lake-town & Dimrost, co. has used to address the change-in-rates 
issue.  I do not believe it creates a negotiated rates issue.  Please let me 
know as soon as possible if you have any concerns.  It is important that we 
work something out with  of Bregolas today.

By the way, I asked Eldalótë if she had asked  of Bregolas to 1) give up their 
right of first refusal and 2) agree to our new capacity release language 
(i.e. Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises gets the upside if capacity is released at a higher rate) in 
exchange for us making this compromise.  She feels that it would be 
inappropriate to ask them because the language below does not quite give 
 of Bregolas what they had requested originally (that is, a negotiated rate).

 of Haldan - Here is the language that  of Bregolas has requested.  They liked and had 
requested the exact wording inserted into their agreement, so if there any 
any changes that you feel needs to be made, please try to keep the changes as 
simple as possible.  Thanks!
