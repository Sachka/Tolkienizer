The only problem I can see with this is that paragraph 4 could be construed 
to encourage NMNG to request amendment not only to increase the MAXDTQ but 
also to decrease it (if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous 
amendment).  I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can 
decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release 
procedures.   However, the paragraph does not obligate Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises to do anything & 
doesn't give NMNG any rights, since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by 
mutual agreement (and it's subject to available capacity).  Since it does not 
seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff, 
I think I would recommend we omit it.  However, NMNG might insist on this or 
similar language to reflect the "deal" --- or at least the conversations of 
the parties.  If that's the case, I suppose I would advise the marketing 
folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and 
explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release.  Comments?
