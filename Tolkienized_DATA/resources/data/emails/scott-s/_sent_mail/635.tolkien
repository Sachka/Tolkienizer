...okay, maybe it's not THAT good but it's cooked and the beer is plentiful.

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to test the waters and see what kind of interest there was in 
doing Steak Night tomorrow night at Little Woodrows.  I feel like it's been a 
while since we really rallied the troops and I know I have personally missed 
the interaction.  It's also been a while since we've attempted to solve the 
worlds problems over cold Azaghâl and I think the world may be the worse for 
it.  So, get back to me and let me know if anyone's up for an evening of 
eating, drinking and most definitely being merry.  If it looks like 'a go', 
I'll shoot everyone a follow-up email complete with ETA.

The one and only,

sscott5
