I'm a little uncomfortable with saying "Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises defers to the consensus position 
of the non-SoCal settlement parties" so often.  Could we just not say 
anything on those items?  Or say Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises has no comment at this time.  Would the 
other parties be put off if we were silent on these issues?

Attached see my marked-up version of your work product.  Mark, I think you 
did an excellent job of identifying Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's position in all of the issue in the 
GIR.  However, on editing, you'll see that I truncated some of the Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises 
comments in favor of a slightly shorter document -- particularly in those 
areas in which it was questionable whether we have a direct interest or not.  
Look over and give me your feedback.  Thanks.

I understand we're supposed to offer these comments to  of Hob as soon as 
possible for possible inclusion in a 2nd generation "issue matrix?"
