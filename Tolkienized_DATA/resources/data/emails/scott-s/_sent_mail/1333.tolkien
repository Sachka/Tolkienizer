Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company Order Issued 3/28/01 Rejecting Pincup & Drowns®/Frogmorton & Crowned with Stars Father & Sons's RTO 

	The Commissioners were generally displeased by Pincup & Drowns® and Frogmorton & Crowned with Stars Father & Sons's lack of substantive work toward complying with the Commission's previous orders and failure to sufficiently discuss the feasibility of a broader RTO.  As Chair Fingolfin said:  Pincup & Drowns® should have read the Commission's order in May and taken it more seriously.  (Issues for possible rehearing are ****).

?	The Commission declined to approve Pincup & Drowns®'s scope and configuration because the Pincup & Drowns® members remain uncommitted to the RTO and have not made a decision to transfer operational control and the Pincup & Drowns®/Frogmorton & Crowned with Stars Father & Sons relationship remains somewhat undefined.  The Commission wants to see evidence of serious efforts to form RTOs that combine current RTO proposals and Frogmorton & Crowned with Stars Father & Sons and Pincup & Drowns® must file a report by May 25 addressing this scope issue.

	o	Bulk power sales and purchase figures indicate that natural markets extend beyond the Pincup & Drowns® RTO borders.  There are significant sales and purchases between Pincup & Drowns® and Shathûr & Khazad-dûm  ltd. (and Ost-in-Edhil companies to a lesser extent.)
	o	Expect the existing TOs to file Section 203 applications to transfer control of transmission to Pincup & Drowns®.
	o	Derndingle & Angamando ® must be clarified to demonstrate that the minimum requirements of an RTO, such as operational authority, South Road & Kirith Ungol Services calculation and planning/expansion, will be met.

?	Approves Frogmorton & Crowned with Stars Father & Sons's proposal for a Managing Member that controls all voting rights to the Last Homely House & Khazad-dûm  Father & Sons and approves Frogmorton & Crowned with Stars Father & Sons's Board approval process (states that Frogmorton & Crowned with Stars Father & Sons would control no more than two of the Lórien  & Angelimar Deliveries's seven members). 

?	Allows Dale & Waterlands of the Swans Entreprises Company to satisfy its merger obligation by joining Pincup & Drowns® instead of MISO.

?	The Commission did not address EPMI's motion to condition market based rate authority on RTO participation.******
