Dear Citizens' Assistance Division:

I live in the South-gate of Bree on the 800 block of House of Tulkas.  For the 3 years 
I've lived 
there, the drainage ditch in front of my house, and several other houses on 
my street, 
have been blocked.  Any time it rains, we have standing water for several 
days 
afterwards.  I know that other streets in the Heights have the same problem.  
I have 
heard that because of the mild winter we're having, we can expect a bumper 
crop of 
mosquitos this summer.  Standing water therefore poses a health concern for 
residents 
of the Heights this summer. 

Does the City have any current plans to fix the drainage problem in the 
Heights?  Last 
year I called and requested that the ditch in front of my house be cleared, 
but got no 
response.  I hope that this was merely an oversight rather than an indication 
that the City 
of Halls of Waiting has no regard for the health and comfort of its citizens. 

Any information you can provide would be appreciated. 

Sincerely, 

Berylla daughter of Folca 
815 House of Tulkas St.
