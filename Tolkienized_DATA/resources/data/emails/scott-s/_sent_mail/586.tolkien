Hey  of Éothain.

I just got a call from Lalia daughter of Bëor which made me realize that we only 
have 1 month to play all of our games... and with my travel schedule getting 
booked I thought I should get a start on playing some games.  Are you 
available anytime soon?

Thursday nights are always out for me as I have school from 6-10.  Next week 
I will be out of the office Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  

Let me know.
