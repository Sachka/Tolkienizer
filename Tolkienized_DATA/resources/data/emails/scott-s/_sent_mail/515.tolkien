Your welcome.  

As for myself, I'm doing pretty good these days.  I've been up in Emyn Eglain 
practically every weekend for the games and have actually been managing to go 
out a bit more here in Halls of Waiting during the week in an effort to become social 
again.  There isn't too much new in Rath Celerdain & Hill of Guard®...the weather's still warm and a 
bit on the muggy side, but what can you expect it's only almost November.  
Today is Wednesday, so of course Steak Night is on the agenda for this 
evening.  Actually, the guy who trained me for my current job is leaving 
Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries and his happy hour just happens to be at Little Woodrow's tonight - how 
convenient.  On the man front, I've put myself back out on the "market" so to 
speak and have a couple of pursuant suitors right now (although, I don't know 
that in the end any of them will pass muster).  Unfortunately for them I am 
somewhat sceptical of guys in general these days (especially ones that I 
can't get background information on through friends), but I'm trying not to 
let that color my opinion too much.  Not to worry about your former neighbor 
either, I haven't seen or talked to him in a couple of weeks and that's okay 
with me.

Drop me a line when you get the chance,
 of Éothain

Thanks for the update.  I worked for Malantur but wrote the whole thing myself 
(50pgs on Grains).  
How are you?  What's new in Rath Celerdain & Hill of Guard®?  What's up on the man front?(--no not my 
old neighbor)
I'll write a bit more soon.  I've been jammed lately and unfortunately it is 
not getting any better.
:)  Thanks for the note.  Looking forward to coming back and having a cold 
one in TX.  I'll buy 
you one!  Silk of the warm ones here.....
