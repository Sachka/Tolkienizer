I have not yet received your comments to the Monthly Report, which is 
attached below.  Please send your comments to me (not Emily) as soon as 
possible.  If you do not have comments this month, please let me know so that 
I can mark you off the list.  Thanks very much! :)

Attached is November's Monthly Report.  I know I'm asking for your revisions 
to it earlier than usual, but with everyone being out during the holidays 
(myself included) we decided it would be easier to incorporate changes you 
make to this report into the Weekly so you only have to update one report.

Linda Lagesse is going to do the updates next week for me while I'm on 
vacation so send your changes and new items to her by Friday, December 
17th.....Thanks....and Merry Christmas everybody......!!!!!
