Strangely enough a Tuesday night would probably be better for me too.  I 
think an all girls gift exchange would be really fun but, as you guys well 
know, I'm up for anything.  As for restaurants, I just tried this new place 
called Narmacil's and it was really good.  It's right across from the Rice Hotel 
downtown and has a neat atmosphere.  Of course there are also all kinds of 
places around our "area of town" that would be great as well...PF  of Forthwini's, Crossing of Poros & Last Homely House©, Dwimordene, King's Lands (sp?), etc. etc.  Just let me know the time and 
place.

Thanks again  of Niënor for organizing all of this, you're the greatest.

PS- If any one has an urge to grab a bite to eat or coffee either tonight or 
tomorrow night let me know.  I feel like I haven't seen you guys in forever.
