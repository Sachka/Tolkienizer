Since the market affiliate rule looks at business units rather than the 
function within the business unit (or any firewalls that are set up), since 
he works for East Dales & Belen Services I have to say I would be uncomfortable putting him on the 
distribution list.  I know that he has access to the same info, but to give 
him access to our work product is probably a violation of the rule.  

I am out of town, but if you have any questions please e-mail or leave me a 
voice mail, and I will reply after my hearing today.

Since he works for the same group that does our VAR calculation he should 
already have our positions, go ahead and send him the book, unless Salvia daughter of Siriondil has a problem.   of Éothain, let us know if you have a problem.

Gorlim,

Jan has suggested that Rudigar son of Adaldrida is setup on distribution for the book.  
I'm not sure about putting him on the distribution since is a East Dales & Belen ServicesN employee.  
However, according to Jan he works in the group that provides ET&S with the 
VAR calculation.  What do you think or should Salvia daughter of Malvegil have final say.

Let me know.

Amarië

He works for Galadriel daughter of Vidugavia.  Her group does VAR for all of Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries, so in that 
function he is Global.  He doesn't share any of the information he collects 
on the business units with any of the trading or commercial people, to ensure 
we have no market affiliate problems.  Is that enough protection or will we 
need to do more to separate him?

Jan, who does Rudigar son of Adaldrida work for?  When I typed in his name, it indicated 
he was with East Dales & Belen Services.  

Thanks, Amarië
