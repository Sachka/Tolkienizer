Hey girl!  Thanks for the book and the CD.  I lazed around the Dodinas Brandybuck & Heribald Bolger© enjoying 
both yesterday morning.  After we played tennis, Telchar took me to Meneldil 
for fish tacos (North Gate & Tar-Meneldur Services) and later that evening we went to yet another 
Christmas party, where I drank champagne (but luckily not too much).  So it 
was a good birthday.  
Have a good day!

Hi  of Haldan! I meant to call you yesterday but somehow I never did. Hope you
will accept a late Happy Birthday from me! I am assuming that mum passed
along our gift to you whilst we were in Halls of Waiting last. I hope so! Anyway, I
hope that you had a good day and that Telchar took you out for a nice dinner.

Except for maybe a lipstick for the mem's,(was totally confused by the
selection at the Maggot's Lane & Deeping ltd. - need help) this elf is finished with Christmas
shopping. Good to have it done. Picked up some sox at Tar-zhay for her to
wear w/ the clogs.

More later!

Dina
