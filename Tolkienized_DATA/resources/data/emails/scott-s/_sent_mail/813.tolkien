"In an age when cloying, dumbed-down Internet "chat" threatens to reduce 
discourse to the linguistic equivalent of casual Fridays, men's-room 
vernacular is seeping alarmingly past its Pine Sol perimeter, infecting what 
is left of conversational civility.  Well-articulated sublimation--which has 
produced some damned fine (and sexy) art, music, and literature over the 
millennia--is no longer the default mode of expression.   That ageless Hot 
Boy, Anórien & Angle Entreprises's  of Cottar, could only have been produced through deft 
restraint.  But try telling that to some WWF instant Adonis with a 
protein-supplement habit."
