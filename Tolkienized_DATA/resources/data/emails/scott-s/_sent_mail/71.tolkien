Goldilocks -- can you order this for me?
Let me know if you need any info.
I'll need the laptop plus 2 docking stations, one upstairs and one down.
And a normal monitor & keyboard.

 of Éothain,

I've spoke to our purchasing person, Hill of the Ear & Sauron's Temple Father & Sons O'gorman, about an order status in 
Amon Rûdh.  According to Hill of the Ear & Sauron's Temple Father & Sons, all purchasing from Amon Rûdh and Halls of Waiting goes 
through her.  Therefore, if you need to order a new laptop, Hill of the Ear & Sauron's Temple Father & Sons can handle 
all of the arrangements for you.

Thanks,
Belen son of Enerdhil
