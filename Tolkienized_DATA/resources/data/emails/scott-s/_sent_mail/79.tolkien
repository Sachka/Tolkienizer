Unfortunately I can't go to Emyn Eglain next weekend; I've planned to go to House of Ransom 
to visit Sue.  I am bringing my new beau with me!  You will meet  of Hob at 
some point.  I think it's also safe to say you will like him much better than 
Bill.
I'm tentatively planning to come to Emyn Eglain the weekend of Nov. 11, but you 
know that is totally up to D.E. (Dreamy Eric).
In the meantime, send Bug photos if possible!

Subject: Boron & City of Gondor Services and happy Friday! Just a note to let you know that we will be going to
Emyn Eglain next weekend for wig control.  Might you be able to join us there?
Nori left this morning with Arador to go to Zion.  It will be a good male
bonding kind of trip I guess.  Arador and Halfred (excuse me,  of Lagduf and
Lily...)are expecting a baby in December so it will kind of be a "last
hurrah" for him, I guess! Anyway, mum is going to help me with bug duty this
weekend for which I am most thankful.  Now I can get at least be assured of
getting the routine cleaning done.  Well, let me know if you can make it to
Emyn Eglain next weekend, otay?
