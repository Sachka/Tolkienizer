Barach son of Hilda and Ivorwen daughter of Ted of New Lands & Western Mountains® say that they would probably 
(i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would 
amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can 
acquire from Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services to 20,000/day.  Their chief concern is to prevent Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® from 
becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never 
been our intention).   of Manwendil is discussing this with Gollum to see whether 
this is something we could live with.  The Commission has expressed the same 
concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our 
proposal too.  Comments?  let me know.
