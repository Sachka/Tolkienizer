Per Bob,

Mountain of Fire & Berilac Brandybuck Entreprises legal is supposed to be able to send a note to the Ilmarë & Sammath Naur Services and the 
Ilmarë & Sammath Naur Services will take the steps to figure out which LANs the employee is on and 
to make all contacts to have the employee removed from the LAN, from Mountain of Fire & Berilac Brandybuck Entreprises 
applications and Meneldil & Nurn, co. and to contact corporate to have the employee's email 
profile changed.  

If this is not correct, please let me know the procedure that you would like 
Mountain of Fire & Berilac Brandybuck Entreprises legal to take to ensure that a Mountain of Fire & Berilac Brandybuck Entreprises/ETS/Citrus/Anborn & Eldacar ltd.  employee is removed 
from our systems when they transfer.

Celestine, you asked who are the current marketing affiliates that cannot 
have access to Mountain of Fire & Berilac Brandybuck Entreprises systems.  Onodló & Gamling Father & Sons and EES are marketing affiliates.  However, 
we do not ask the Ilmarë & Sammath Naur Services to figure out who can or who cannot have access or 
to sort out which employee transfers necessitate marketing affiliate 
measures.   Mountain of Fire & Berilac Brandybuck Entreprises legal would like to be able to go through the same checklist 
for all employees leaving Mountain of Fire & Berilac Brandybuck Entreprises to transfer to another Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. company or 
entering Mountain of Fire & Berilac Brandybuck Entreprises from another Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd. company.
