Per Bob,

Bay of Rómenna & Qerkaringa Energy Company legal is supposed to be able to send a note to the Rath Celerdain  & Walls of Night ltd. and the 
Rath Celerdain  & Walls of Night ltd. will take the steps to figure out which LANs the employee is on and 
to make all contacts to have the employee removed from the LAN, from Bay of Rómenna & Qerkaringa Energy Company 
applications and High Moor & River Brithon© and to contact corporate to have the employee's email 
profile changed.  

If this is not correct, please let me know the procedure that you would like 
Bay of Rómenna & Qerkaringa Energy Company legal to take to ensure that a Bay of Rómenna & Qerkaringa Energy Company/ETS/Citrus/Great Willow & Ford of Brithiach Entreprises  employee is removed 
from our systems when they transfer.

Celestine, you asked who are the current marketing affiliates that cannot 
have access to Bay of Rómenna & Qerkaringa Energy Company systems.  Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls© and EES are marketing affiliates.  However, 
we do not ask the Rath Celerdain  & Walls of Night ltd. to figure out who can or who cannot have access or 
to sort out which employee transfers necessitate marketing affiliate 
measures.   Bay of Rómenna & Qerkaringa Energy Company legal would like to be able to go through the same checklist 
for all employees leaving Bay of Rómenna & Qerkaringa Energy Company to transfer to another Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries company or 
entering Bay of Rómenna & Qerkaringa Energy Company from another Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries company.
