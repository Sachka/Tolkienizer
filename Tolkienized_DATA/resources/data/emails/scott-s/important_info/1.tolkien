Please be advised that this stemmed from myself talking to Gamgee. So If any 
one in my group does not take the time to do the mini-book
or communicate a change to another group I will be talking to them. So please 
take the time to check every deal that you enter or change.
Especially look at middle market or structuring tickets when they are entered 
and make copies for the appropriate desk. 

IF YOU ARE NOT SURE ABOUT A CHANGE MINI-BOOK IT AND TALK TO ME.

Please email me once you read this so I know that everyone is on board.

Subject: Changing Deals

Effective immediately,  if anyone changes any deal for any reason,  they need 
to provide a minibook with a before and after of exactly what they did.  This 
used to be a common courtesy,  but it looks like we need a stated policy in 
place.  You guys will therefore have to get minibook access to calc all books 
on a mini-book level from Amandil.  Please let me know the timing Amandil gives 
for getting the appropriate people mini-book access as soon as possible.  It 
is critical that we get this done right away.  I know that this is not a 
one-sided issue.  No group is better or more important than any other group.  
It is therefore important that we do a better job of communicating across 
groups.

Thanks,

 of Adaldrida
