Yes, I have a fax at work:? 82-31-690-6295.? Sorry you are having to fool 
with all of that.? I'm sure you're right and I'll talk to you sometime 
tomorrow.

Hey Borlad,

I was wondering if there was a fax number at the base so that my apartment
complex can send you some info. regarding getting your name taken off of
our lease. If there is, just shoot me off an email with the number and
I'll pass it along to them.

Hope things are going well and that you're not too homesick with
Thanksgiving and all. I have a feeling I will be talking to you guys
tomorrow along with both of our parents and extended family members. Have
a great holiday and root on the Horns ( I think this is going to be a tough
one).

Love,
 of Haldan
