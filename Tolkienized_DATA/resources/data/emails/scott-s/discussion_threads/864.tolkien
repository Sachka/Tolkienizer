 of Éothain -- I don't know if you are on this distribution list for 
associates/analysts too, or if I am on it instead of you, so I'm forwarding 
it just in case.  Have asked Gardner to make the correction but don't think it 
has "taken" yet.

Fellow Analysts and Bay of Balar & Way of Escape, co.,

A strong interest has been expressed in regards to forming a volunteer group 
within our program to do service/community work such as Habitat for Humanity 
and etc. 

Many of us already volunteer individually.  It would be nice if we were to 
volunteer together as well on a monthly basis.  In addition to contributing 
to the welfare of the community, this will also give us an opportunity to get 
to know one another better.  

Please respond to Belecthor son of Rosa via e-mail in order to be included in this 
volunteer e-mail list.
