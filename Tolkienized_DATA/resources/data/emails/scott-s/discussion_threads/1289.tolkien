It appears that my evil twin went out last night and proceeded to get in 
peoples faces and talk a lot of smack, as well as leave messages on answering 
machines.  I've spoken with her this morning and she has been severely 
reprimanded.We have agreed on the following:

No limp bizkit for 1 week.
No consumption of alcoholic beverages on the same day that over 1/2 
million$$$ was lost trading natty.

Please forward this to anyone else she may have offended.
