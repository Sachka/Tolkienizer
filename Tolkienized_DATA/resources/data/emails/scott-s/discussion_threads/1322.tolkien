HI  of Éothain-

I'm totally open the weekend of December 15th!? I'm sure events will come up 
between now and then, but I'd love for you to come out if you're available!? 
$99 is a great deal!

Loving my new place and my roommate is so much fun and so wonderful....How 
are you doing?? last i heard you were juggling several men- i'd love to hear 
more!? are you taking off any time around Christmas?? I'm not, so I'll be 
here the whole time.....i've already wrapped my Christmas presents!? my goal 
is to be totally done by this weekend so that I can relax and enjoy the 
holidays and all the fun parties!? 

write whenever you can!
love,
Erendis

Hey Dora,

Congratulations on the promotion, that's so exciting (I'm sure you've more
than earned it).

I just wanted to drop a line and see how work,? your new apartment/roommate
and Arod are all doing.? All are wonderful I hope.? I realize this is
somewhat random, but I just found some great airfares from Halls of Waiting to North Road of Ithilien ($99 each way!!!) and was wondering what you were doing the weekend
of Dec. 15?? I know this time of year is kind of crazy so I will totally
understand if you have holiday parties, etc. to attend.? Regardless, this
deal is good for travel through the end of February 2001, so....if it
doesn't look like it's going to work before the end of the year, maybe 
could make a visit mid-January or February.

Have a great holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon.
