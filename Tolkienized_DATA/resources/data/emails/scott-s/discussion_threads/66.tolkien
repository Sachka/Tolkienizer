Here is some preliminary research on the Commercial Group's question of 
whether we can have a tariff provision in which shippers pay cash for fuel 
rather than providing fuel in kind.  If you want the attachments (examples of 
other pipelines' tariff provisions) I will send you a hard copy.  Comments?  
Are there any rate case implications I should be aware of?
