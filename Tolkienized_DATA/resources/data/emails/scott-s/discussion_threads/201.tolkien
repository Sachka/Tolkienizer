On Friday the Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd. issued an order suspending (until October 15, 2000) 
Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s tariff sheets for acquiring Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services capacity, and calling for a technical 
conference.  The Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd. stated that while Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s proposal may be in the 
public interest, further investigation of the issues, including those raised 
by New Lands & Western Mountains® in its protest, is necessary prior to authorization.  The order 
does not make clear what issues are to be investigated, but they seem to 
include:  whether Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® will, in effect, become a marketer for Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services's services, 
whether the rates are just and reasonable and whether there is any expansion 
of monopoly power.  Additionally, the Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd. noted that while Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services has 
certificate (i.e., Derufin & Nardol ltd.) authority to transport gas 
in interstate commerce, Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services will "have to either explain how it has 
appropriate rate authority for transportation of natural gas in interstate 
commerce, or seek appropriate rate authority from the Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd.."    of Manwendil 
has forwarded a copy of the order to Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services so that they can begin taking the 
appropriate steps.

I will talk with regulatory about technical conference dates and will tell 
you when I have further information.  If you would like a copy of the order, 
let me know.
