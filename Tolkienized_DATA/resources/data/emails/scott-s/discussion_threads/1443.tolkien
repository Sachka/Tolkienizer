Emeldir,

I would bring some type of apetizer - don't know what though - MÃ­riel may have
better ideas.  Maybe chips and salsa ???  Cokes/DP?  Yes, it is on the 11th
(Monday)

Love,  of Holman

Hey  of Holman,

Good job on the organization.  Do you have any recommendations for what I
could bring or is there anything you think we really need?  Also, just to
double check, we're getting together next Monday night right?
