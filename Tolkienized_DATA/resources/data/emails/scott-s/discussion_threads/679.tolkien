Linda,
Sorry it took longer than I thought to get back with you. Marketing had 
several issues come up last week.

Here are the answers to your questions.

Item 1. Is this a contract waiver? I talked with  of Manwendil and here is what 
Marketing wants: They would like the request form to be at a shipper level 
(LE Level) that applies to all their new, current and future Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries contracts. 
Since it will be a manual process, can you keep an Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries waiver log/book that 
is at a LE level, then place a copy of this signed overrun request form in 
each Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries contract file & change the flag to Yes on each active Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries contract 
for that shipper?
Item 2. Can they change their mind on the waiver-if so would this require an 
amendment to the contract? Answer - Yes they can change, so the field needs 
to be date effective, but would like it to be an administrative amendment 
with new request form signed by the shipper ( not an amendment through the 
contract). This would be a change for all their Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries contracts since marketing 
wants to keep it simple at an LE Shipper Level.
Item 3. Can the waiver be date sensitive? Answer -  Yes, Salvia daughter of Marcho will 
review the request form and make any changes needed. I will forward a copy of 
the draft I did to you and marketing and  of Éothain to review.
Item 4. Is the contracts group suppose to be the keeper of the waiver? Answer 
- Yes, Marketing suggested that a Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries Waiver book be set up, then also they 
would like a copy of the signed request form to be in each Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries contract file.
Item 5. When is the shipper suppose to submit the waiver - at request time? 
Answer - Yes at the time they are executing their first Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries contract. When we 
have the system changes in production, I will let marketing know, & they will 
advise the shippers of this new waiver.
Item 6. Where will the waiver reside? With the request, on the Web under 
blank forms? Answer - Yes, on the web, under Contracts-blank forms for  Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®. 

Please let me know if you have any other issues.

Subject: Re: Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries changes

 of Manwendil,
I talked with Linda daughter of Poppy this morning about  the Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries waiver & from what I 
could remember we  decided to send the  form letter for the waiver  with the 
Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries contract so it would be effective for the time frame of the Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries 
agreement. The system should default to no waiver which means the Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries shipper 
would be scheduled to zero when we call an Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries day at their point. If we have 
the waiver, then the flag will be set to yes. During scheduling we will 
schedule their Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries as overrun if capacity at the point was available. I do 
not have a draft waiver form, but I can get a copy of one that Primrose Boffin & Ingwë® uses.  You 
may want to address these issues from Linda. See her questions below.


Thanks Adanel

Thats more than a couple ?s.  I guess I would suggest that we talk to Adanel 
and whichever Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® Marketer sponsored Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries.  I guess I didn't see it as any more 
than an interpertation of a nom as interruptible when Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries firm was not 
available, but I can tell that you have many more concerns.

Subject: Re: Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries changes  

Yes but I have a couple of more questions:

Is this a contract level waiver?
Can they change their mind on the waiver - if so would this require an 
amendment to the contract? 
Can the waiver be date sensitive - meaning yes today, no tomorrow?
Is there a draft of the waiver yet?
Is the contract group suppose to be the keeper of this waiver?  
When is the shipper suppose to submit the waiver - at request time?
Where will the waiver reside?  With the request, on the Web under blank forms?

Let me know.

Thanks

Linda

Primrose Boffin & Ingwë® was included in this discussion prior to our rejection order.  No longer 
pertains to Primrose Boffin & Ingwë® -   I am familiar with this issue.  The situation was 
described to me as follows:   Shipper has a standing nom for a month.  i.e.   
a firm 100/day at a receipt point.  sometime during the month we call a Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries 
day at the receipt point,  the nom would automatically become an 
interruptible nom for the Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries which may or may not be scheduled,  but the key 
is that the Shipper does not have to watch the notice and make a specific 
nom.  Does that answer your questions?

Mimosa,
Linda called asking about these enhancements--specifically why is Primrose Boffin & Ingwë® 
included in an Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries enhancement and did we know about this overrun provision 
on Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries days.  Are you familiar with this?

Linda,

Here is the document. It posted out on the ET&S website for the Thrór & Ruby Bolger Services unit under Enhancement Request In Progress Item # 523. 
The flag we must add to contracts is need when a shipper is granting us 
arthorization to schedlue their Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries firm gas as overrun on days when Dunharrow & Aros, co. is not available.
Please review and get with me on Friday. Legal and regulatory have approved 
this scheduling of overrun volumes for Nen Echui & Hidden Rock Deliveries contracts for both Primrose Boffin & Ingwë® and Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® so I 
think we will need to add the flag indicator to both contract systems.



Thanks Adanel
