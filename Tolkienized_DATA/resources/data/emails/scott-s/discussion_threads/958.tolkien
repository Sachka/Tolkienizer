Thanks for the info...you are a wealth of knowledge.  As for the jokes, I am 
very afraid and yet undaunted.

Do me one last favor and tell Malantur son of Elenwë said he's a real funny guy and that 
there will, at some point, be appropriate pay-back.

I just don't know where to start with the last couple of sentences so I will 
let any jokes pass for now but be afraid.  As for the people on the list, I 
know them as follows:

Arminas son of Atanatar: Gothmog & Bent Seas Deliveries, UT b-school, emissions trader and a funny guy - spent a few 
drunken nights with him and he lives in your complex
Fengel Pasad: Land of Willows, UT b-school, really nice guy but no drinking or meat 
eating (he drove me to get my car on Monday)
Arahael son of Gorbulas: White Downs & Togo Goodbody Deliveries mba and trades gas, nice guy
Glirhuin son of Thorondor: works in my old group with Fengel, very smart Sea of Rhûn & Goldwine Deliveries mba nice 
but quiet

I hope this helps and if you have any other questions, just let me know you 
little hottie.

Hey,
 
I know you are monumentally busy this week, but if you get five minutes today 
shoot me back an email and let me know if you know any of the Associates 
below.  They are all going to be at the dinner tonight so any info that would 
boost my B.S. factor would be much appreciated.  I seem to remember you 
mentioning Arminas son of Atanatar on a couple of occasions but I have, albeit very 
rarely, been known to be wrong.  Hope your day is going well and that you 
aren't having to carry Malantur too much.

-- I finally watched the movie last night.  I laughed, I cried...it became a 
part of me.  Honestly though, it was a very funny flick.  So did Arminas son of Fimbrethil pass along the "Bible" to you?  (Whoever it was you can thank them for 
me.)
