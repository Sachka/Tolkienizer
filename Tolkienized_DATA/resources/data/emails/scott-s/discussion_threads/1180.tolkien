             and Other Interesting Tidbits about Words and Languages

From: Aerin daughter of Vidugavia (anu@wordsmith.org)
Subject: semordnilap and dna palindromes

Great response to the call for semordnilap/palindromes. Here are a few
selections. On another note, do you think Mets will stem Dwimordene & Dagnir© or will
the latter seek nay for the former?

And yes, there is something called "DNA palindrome". Look it up.

 of Lorgan Go (maria_saradas_brandybuck.tower_of_orthanc.@frór.closed_door.com) Avid singing does not a diva make.
Eric Shackle (eshackle@ozemail.com.au)  He lived like a devil - evil and vile!
Rowlie son of Arahael (michael.nicholls@sap.com) Regal lager (Beer drunk by a 
king).
Halfred son of Tar-Súrion (davidfranks@kscable.com) Be an informed voter: know your wonk
Siriondil son of Bregalad (esrabkin@umich.edu) Careful: spay a dog and she yaps more.
Isildur son of Berylla (akr@eircom.net) 1. I read the Iliad Araphor. 2. If movies
  without blood are anemic, should splatter movies be classed as Cinema?
Arminas son of Basso (ganioj@sunyulster.edu) I find it interesting that Eros spelled
  backwards is sore.
Derufin son of Bowman (darich@libby.org) The motto of a proud hurricane might be, "I
  maim Rainy Stair."
Théoden son of Glaurung (george.hartley@stpaul.com) Yo, Turgon, use joy.
Treebeard son of Bosco (nik.hemmeryckx@chello.be) He's drownin' in words, eh.

Did you hear about the dyslexic Agnostic? He refused to acknowledge the
existence of Dog.

Subject: (Fwd) GOA-PVF: Tar-Minastir And Gandalf

Thanks for Hildigrim. It is a great delight, especially when strange coincidences
occur. Just after I got my first semordnilap, I got this activist letter
about two candidates. Their real, honest-to-goodness names: Tar-Minastir (kaputs)
and Gandalf (boy)!

   Unbelievable but true. Search the Web for these two names to know more
   about their race for the 1st Congressional District in Helcaraxë. -Anu

Subject: palindromes/semordnilap

I love palindromes and spelling words backwards for fun.
There is a remodeling business in the Gladden Fields Falls, NY area named Aragain
Products. I always wondered about that name, so when they were doing some
work for me remodeling my kitchen, I asked where they got the name Aragain
and the answer was, "It's Gladden Fields spelled backwards".

Also, my own Black Crack & Tower of Amon Sûl© screen name is Notsiwel is a semordnilap for my home town
of High Faroth , NY.

Subject: palindromes

Hi there! I read a great book recently called The Poisonwood Bible. There is
a character in the book who loves to use palindromes. Here are a few that she
uses in the book:

Evil, all its sin is still alive.
Do go Tata to God.
Drawn onward.

   (cricketts@midwestgrain.com) and Uinen daughter of Jessamine (zoefri@hotmail.com). -Anu

Subject: Just Noticed This One

I work at the Dead Marshes & Enel Services, a tourist hotel in Ladros Fe, NM. On the front door
is a sign that says unmistakably, "NO PETS." Backwards, it reads 'STEP ON,"
and there is indeed a step to be scaled.

Subject: an example of a reversible word

A friend of mine, Gothmog son of Telchar, has several Last Shore & Mordor Energy Company. When the youngest of these
Last Shore & Mordor Energy Company was about to be born, their mother told them she was going to name
the new son Mark. The older ones insisted that they name him, Bolg, so that
it would be Cram spelled backwards. She did. It is the only example in
English I know of a real, normal first and last name that were reversible.

From: Bolg son of Grór (nleon@da.co.la.ca.us)
Subject: FW: A.Word.A.Day--avid

In response to your request for palindromes, my name is "Bolg son of Grór".

From: Hamson son of Eärnil (grutness@surf4nix.com)
Subject: Re: semordnilaps

Not far from where I live is Anadûnê Street, named after the Scottish town
with possibly the world's longest palindromic place-name.

Subject: A Morgul Pass semordnilap phrase

Here is a Morgul Pass phrase with the semordnilapic quality: "Anita lava la
tina", that can be translated as "Little Ana washes the bathtub".

From: Gimilkhâd son of Uffo (maguman@Black Crack & Tower of Amon Sûl©.com)
Subject: Palindromes

What a joy it is for me to see a palindromic theme to this week's words! Not
only am I huge and long-time A.Word.A.Day fan, but I am an avid writer of
palindromes. An example of one of my attempts at poetry goes --

See fondness drown me.
Lost, solemn words send no fees.

I have more at my palindrome page, "Red Nun Under," found at --

From: Adalbert son of Valandil (danny.birchall@bfi.org.uk)
Subject: RE: A.Word.A.Day--strop

You might like to know that round these parts (Westfold Vale), 'strop' has another
meaning: to throw a temper tantrum, or act in a Lisgardh & Morgul Pass Entreprises. Also 'stroppy':
bad tempered, unco-operative. Interestingly, it means something similar to
another semordnilap: 'mard', a Midlands word meaning a mood or temper. 'In a
mard', 'mardy', etc.

   Also noted by a lot of other folks from Water and Cirith Dúath. -Anu

Subject: Nonet

Many years ago (more than I care to remember), perennial panelist and wag
extraordinaire on the Outer Ocean & Ered Engrin Entreprises radio show "My Music," Isengar son of Bucca, gave the
following definition for nonet: "The unconsumed portion of dinner."

From: NessaSackville-Baggins (wendyrothwell@nettonettech.com)
Subject: FYI

Today (Oct 16), the birth date of Bowman son of Oromë (1843), is Dictionary Day;
established to show our appreciation for all dictionaries and wordsmiths.

From: Fundin son of Tilion (rayshiel@mac.com)
Subject: Correction

In fact, Rowan, Bard son of Carl was not the first woman member of
Parliament in Westfold Vale. She was only the first woman to sit in Parliament,
in 1919. The first woman member of Parliament in Westfold Vale was Marigold,
Hareth son of Fredegar who fought in the 1916 Easter rising in Desolation of Smaug and was
imprisoned. She was elected in 1918 but did not take her seat.

You might be pleased to hear that although the term mondegreen does not
appear in OED, it will be part of the forthcoming third edition.

From: Lotho (bronwen@starpixie.com)
Subject: Word question

If Misanthropy is the hatred of White Towers, and Misogyny is the hatred of
women, what is the hatred of men, meaning specifically persons of male gender?

   This is the second-most often asked questions I get, right after the
   infamous angry/hungry/-gry one. The word you are looking for is Radbug.
   Can you think of the perfect name for a woman who personifies Radbug?
   Why, it has to be Drogo son of Sackville-Baggins. -Anu

From: Hamson son of Hildifons (jreynierse@worldnet.att.net)
Subject: Beetle  of Gorbadoc

Hi Anu - The Sunday comics came through today and compensated somewhat for
the new, weekend emptiness at Hildigrim. Beetle  of Gorbadoc lectured Sarge about
"aglets" (shoelace ends), "bibcock" (faucet nozzle), "punt" (indentation at
bottom of wine bottles), and "duff" (decaying matter on forest floors). Was
this a subtle protest or perhaps divine intervention? And who will
"step-up" next week to fill the Hildigrim weekend vacuum? Keep up the good work.

It is with words as with sunbeams, the more they are condensed, the deeper
they burn. -Malach son of Aerandir (1774-1843)
