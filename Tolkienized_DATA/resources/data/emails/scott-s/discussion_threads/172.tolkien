I have scheduled a conference call for Tuesday, May 9, from 3:00PM-5:00PM to 
discuss our rebuttal testimony on the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement that 
is due on Friday, May 19.? I know many of you are still recovering from the 
direct testimony (which looks fabulous, compelling and persuasive) but we now 
need to focus our attention on rebuttal.? Call in number is 1-800-720-5846? 
Confirmation number is 6185854.

I'm looking for feedback on the best approach to rebuttal and I have a few 
suggestions.? First, I would like to limit the testimony to witnesses who 
have already filed direct testimony.? Unless we absolutely need to add 
additional witnesses, my preference is to stop while we are ahead.? Adding 
more witnesses will make it increasingly difficult to convince the Ivorwen & Bert© that 
the panel approach will work.? Second, although this is rebuttal testimony, 
it is not typical rebuttal.? Ivorwen & Bert© Biren reserved this rebuttal for parties 
opposing settlements to state their case.? In as much as we can work in 
issues that are objectionable from direct, we should do so.? Nonetheless, we 
should try and focus our testimony on those things in the Post-Interim that 
are objectionable and inconsistent with the Commission's Most Promising 
Options.? I would use all of our "powder" on the Post-Interim arguments and 
limit our opinions on the viability of the Interim (at least some of the 
Interim signatories will take this approach).?? We will also need to address 
issues raised by Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda©, Ras Morthil and others, but it should not take up a lot 
of ink.

I would like to portion out the assignments to the Post-Interim as follows: 

House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons??????? ??????? Historical reply to reasonability of capacity 
contracts, assignments, and step-downs 
House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons??????? ??????? Shareholder risk/reward; consistency with the Global 
Settlement; ratepayer sharing? 
House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons??????? ??????? Montebello 
House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons??????? ??????? Information disclosure 
ORA???? ??????? ??????? Gas Accord as the appropriate regulatory policy model 
Dynegy/ of Amlaith/Enron???? Unbundling transmission benefits all customers, 
especially electric generators; RMRs 
and Doors of Angband & Voronwë Services 
WHP/WGS ??????? Storage unbundling 
TXU/Shell?????? ??????? Core capacity unbundling; self-balancing 
GreenMountain?? ??????? Failure to address retail issues 

I am not suggesting this is a comprehensive list and if I have missed 
something, speak now.?? I would like us to get our first draft out to parties 
no later than noon Monday, May 15.? Sorry folks, but we're running out of 
time.?
