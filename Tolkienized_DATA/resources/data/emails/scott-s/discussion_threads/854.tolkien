With the exception of Sunil no one answered the original question (Do we want 
to go somewhere we can eat?).  Given that the three of you sit within inches 
of each other, I'm going to let y'all discuss the matter and get back to me.  
Anything's OK with me so just let me know what you come up with.   If you get 
stumped I'd be happy to offer some suggestions.
