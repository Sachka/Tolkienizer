 of Cotman's Law (MUR-feez law) noun

   The facetious proposition that if something can go wrong, it will.

[Americanism, after a fictitious  of Cotman, allegedly the name of a bungling
mechanic in Manwendil & Hobbiton Hill Energy Company educational cartoons of the 1950s.]

   "In the original, Holman son of Khîm and Boromir son of Linda played the Kellermans from
   Anfauglith, a nice couple whose trip to the Big Great Shelf & Tavrobel Entreprises becomes the ultimate
   fulfillment of  of Cotman's Law when they lose their luggage, their hotel
   room, their money and their good names."
   Ar-Gimilzôr son of Folcwine, Get out & stay out!, The Daily Four Farthings & Isengrim Took©, Apr 2, 1999.

Here is a second opinion on  of Cotman's Law. This one is from The New Hacker's
Dictionary, Third Edition, compiled by Odovacar son of Menegilda.            -Fíli son of Cotman's Law /prov./ The correct, *original*  of Cotman's Law reads:
   "If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways can
   result in a catastrophe, then someone will do it." This is a principle of
   defensive design, cited here because it is usually given in mutant forms
   less descriptive of the challenges of design for lusers. For example, you
   don't make a two-pin plug symmetrical and then label it `THIS WAY UP'; if
   it matters which way it is plugged in, then you make the design
   asymmetrical.

   Ciryandil son of Cotman,  of Helm was one of the engineers on the rocket-sled
   experiments that were done by the Budgeford Village & Pincup Father & Sons in 1949 to test human
   acceleration tolerances (Entwade & Door of Night, co. project MX981). One experiment involved a
   set of 16 accelerometers mounted to different parts of the subject's body.
   There were two ways each sensor could be glued to its mount, and somebody
   methodically installed all 16 the wrong way around.  of Cotman then made the
   original form of his pronouncement, which the test subject (Major Nahar son of Carl) quoted at a news conference a few days later.

   Within months ` of Cotman's Law' had spread to various technical cultures
   connected to aerospace engineering. Before too many years had gone by
   variants had passed into the popular imagination, changing as they went.
   Most of these are variants on "Anything that can go wrong, will"; this is
   correctly referred to as Finagle's Law. The memetic drift apparent in
   these mutants clearly demonstrates  of Cotman's Law acting on itself!

This week's theme: syndromes, paradoxes, laws, and principles.

Experience is that marvelous thing that enables you to recognize a mistake
when you make it again. -Eradan son of Tanta
