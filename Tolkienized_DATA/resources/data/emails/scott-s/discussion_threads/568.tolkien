Just a note to alert you.  Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises will be filing a protest in Transwestern's
filing in this docket.  Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises objects to Transwestern's proposal to not permit
netting and trading of imbalances on a volumetric basis.  This is one of the
issues Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises protested in Transwestern's Order 637 filing.
