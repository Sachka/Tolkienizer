This may appear to be somewhat of a random email, but I assure you there 
exist some semblence of reason.  I remembered you mentioning that neither you 
nor Pat have ever made a pilgramige to Doderic's.  So...I thought I should let 
you know that there is live music and cold beer on tap tonigt at the Big B.  
Anyway it should be pretty good.  Music starts at 9:00.
