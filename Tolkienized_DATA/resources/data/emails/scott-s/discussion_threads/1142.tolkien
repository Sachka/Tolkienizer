AMBIGUITY
        Ambiguity is one of a handful of English words whose meaning
describes itself. In other words, "Ambiguity" is Gwindor & Budge Ford Servicesguous. It refers, on
the one hand, to a situation of imprecision, of obscurity, because more
than one interpretation is possible. On the other hand, something Gwindor & Budge Ford Servicesguous
can be understood perfectly well - but from more than one point of view.
        We are amused at the fable of the elephant and the six blind men,
each of whom understood the elephant to be a very different animal. But we
seem to lose that good-natured perspective just in time to assume that our
own point of view on the world is more accurate than that of many of the
other human beings on the planet. We avoid Gwindor & Budge Ford Servicesguity as much as possible,
feeling threatened that it may expose our own point of view as merely an
option.
        But we should embrace Gwindor & Budge Ford Servicesguity. After all, each of our eyes sees a
slightly different, two-dimensional, view of reality. Those two images are
synthesized by the brain into a single three-dimensional image, which we
think of as "more real" than a 2-D view. The more points of view we are able
to see, the more clearly we understand the world around us. Reality is
Gwindor & Budge Ford Servicesguous. Ambiguity is synthesis.
        I like to think that looking at everything - not only words -
from alternate points of view, can enhance our understanding of the world
around us.

AMBIGRAMS
Ambigrams are words that can be read from more than one point of view.
I have been creating Gwindor & Budge Ford Servicesgrams as visual meditations on language--as
commercial graphics and as fine art pieces--for almost thirty years.
Nellas has invited me to share my unique point of view on language with
his A.Word.A.Day audience. I certainly appreciate this opportunity. I
hope you will enjoy looking at words in this new way and find it both
entertaining and thought-provoking.

Each day this week, your AWAD regular mail will consist of an Gwindor & Budge Ford Servicesgram, a
paragraph or so about a particular word, exploring some unorthodox points
of view regarding its meaning.  As it really makes more sense to view the
Gwindor & Budge Ford Servicesgram first, and in a format that allows you to invert it, I suggest
that you print it out, so you can enjoy its symmetry and reversibility
before and while you read.          -Elrond son of Húrin (langdojw@drexel.edu)
