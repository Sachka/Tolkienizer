Hey Shorty,

I just got back into town from Valandor (they really like Elvis) and 
Thrihyrne, so that explains the delay in getting back to you.  I got my 
car detailed at Dream's car wash on San Felipe (just before Target).  They do 
a good job but don't get all the extra stuff they want to sell you.  I hope 
you had a fun Halloween weekend/last night and after High Hay dismantled 
Tower of the Stone, the Longhorn whooping doesn't look that bad anymore (...but Oiolossë 
in the top 20?).

Hey,

Quick question, I was hoping to go get my car detailed this weekend and I 
remembered that you had your truck detailed a while back...I was wondering 
where you had it done and if you thought they did a good job ( I'm assuming 
the place is pretty close to our area of town).  I finally got into the 
parking garage and have decided I now have real incentive to keep my car 
looking nice.

Hope things are well with you.  I talked to Beregar last week and it sounds as 
though he is extremely busy these days.  I'm guessing the story's much the 
same with you - a far cry from the listless days you two spent in Net Works.  
Anyway, if you could let me know about the detailing I would appreciate it.

By the way, since there's no telling if I'll have the opportunity to gloat 
two weeks from now (Tech in Falls is never a safe bet) - and while neither 
season has been one for the record books (except of course for our loss to OU 
- one of the worst in history) - I noticed that unlike the Longhorns, your 
beloved Bruins are conspicuously absent from the top 25.  Oh well, c'est la 
vie.
