Subject: Order on Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises Options

I just received a call from Rowan daughter of Wilimar informing me that Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company has issued a 
draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May 
1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference.  
The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and 
will address issues raised in protests.
I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon.  Please call or e-mail 
me if you have questions.
