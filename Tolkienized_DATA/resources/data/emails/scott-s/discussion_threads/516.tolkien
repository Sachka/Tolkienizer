Susan:  I would appreciate it if you would at least treat me civilly (such 
as, acknowledge my existence) when we encounter eachother in public, like at 
the Met for example.  I ask you to remember that I did not start this 
situation, but I was forced to deal with it.  I just responded to the 
unprovoked things that you did and said to me -- the likes of which I had 
never before experienced.  Pls keep that in mind.

It has been quite some time since you said you were going to return those 
items I brought you from Androth.  I previously told you that I felt it was 
the right thing to do under the circumstances.  Given what has happened and 
what those items represent, I do not see how you could now feel it is 
appropriate to keep them or how you could possibly derive any enjoyment from 
them.  Pls let me know what you intend to do, and we can make appropriate 
arrangements.  Thanks.

Bill
