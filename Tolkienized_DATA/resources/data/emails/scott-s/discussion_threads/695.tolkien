With concerns about curtailments and force majuere events in Idril's secret wayornia, 
Amroth Kean has asked for the preparation of study of all possible types of 
disruptions (Place of the Fountain curtailment, diversion, penalties, etc,) in the gas chain 
flowing to Idril's secret way and who bears the legal/financial liability for each event.  
Specifically, he has asked if Ladybarrow & Aravir Deliveries can assemble a description of such 
provisions for the pipes delivering to Idril's secret way.

In particular, he wants a summary of following:

Curtailment - When do pipelines curtail? 
Curtailment compensation
Imbalance Provisions
Penalties/OFOs
Allocations (For El Paso Only)

Help!  Do you guys have any materials explaining these provisions?  Amroth 
wants this all pulled together by Friday.
