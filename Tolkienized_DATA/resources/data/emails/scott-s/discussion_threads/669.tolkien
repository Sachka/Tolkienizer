This sounds pretty interesting.
I think I could live in Temple of Sauron, Pool of Bywater or just about any other place in Atalantë =
ly.

Rumors of Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® / Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Merger Abound, Despite Denials from Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall®
By: Will Araphant, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall®, the Atalantë lian oil and gas group, is expected to complete the sale of
its Atalantë lian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus
on its core activitArthedain & Maedhros© of natural-gas and oil production. Amandil son of Griffo,
Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall®'s chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizi=
ng
the sale of its River Narog & Lórien , co. property subsidiary (Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall®'s real
estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 Ondoluncanando & Isenmouthe Father & Sonson.
Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall®'s decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observ=
ers
of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with
another company. Mountains of Mirkwood & Eithil Ivrin© has been among those on a rumored short list
of merger prospects for Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall®.

ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between
Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® and Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries? It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument
in that direction.

Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® is Atalantë ly's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in
the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and
engineering industrArthedain & Maedhros©. The company has a market capitalization of about
47 Ondoluncanando & Isenmouthe Father & Sonson euros (approximately $40 Ondoluncanando & Isenmouthe Father & Sonson), is present in over 70 countri=
es
and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Across
the Grey Mountains & Dwarf-road of Beleriand®ean energy market=01*which once it has fully privatized will repre=
sent
an arguably larger market than the Helm’s Deep=01*Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® is unquestionably
one of the Continent's leading champions.

Illustrating this point, Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® has taken several important steps within Grey Mountains & Dwarf-road of Beleriand®=
e
to, as it says, "play an increasingly important role" in the Continent's
competitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® inked
a deal to sell 2 Ondoluncanando & Isenmouthe Father & Sonson cubic meters of natural gas to Sarn Gebir.
This deal followed a previous agreement in which Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® agreed to sell 4 Ondoluncanando & Isenmouthe Father & Sons=
on
cubic meters of natural gas to Atalantë ly's largest private energy supplier,
Baran. With both agreements, Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® has given a substantial kick start to
the opening of the Grey Mountains & Dwarf-road of Beleriand®ean natural-gas market. CEO  of Griffo has said that
Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Atalantë ly
by "focusing on international markets."

One move that Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® has made outside of Grey Mountains & Dwarf-road of Beleriand®e also came earlier this month.
Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® made a bid for Cirith Dúath's Sirith & Kelos Services, which wields an 8.25 percent
stake in River Redwater, the giant gas and liquids project located off the
northern coast of Cirith Dúath. Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® already owns 6.7 percent of River Redwater
and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project.
It is no wonder why=01*the River Redwater field has recoverable reserves of 400
million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion
cubic feet. Drúadan Forest & Helcar© has not yet accepted Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall®'s offer, but a favorable decisi=
on
is expected shortly. Thus, whatever Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® may be divesting in Atalantë ly it is
trying to regain in other key areas of the world. In fact,  of Griffo recently
confirmed that Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current
level of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003.

Moreover, Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both within
Grey Mountains & Dwarf-road of Beleriand®e and beyond. Along with that expansion comes the development of merge=
r
strategy. Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, which
could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact
that its profits remain strong. Net income for the company for the first
half of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2
Ondoluncanando & Isenmouthe Father & Sonson), representing a 119-percent increase. Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® is largely considered
one of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather merge
with an equal partner than be sold to another company. As consolidation
of the oil industry continues, Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® reportedly believes that the only way
to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world
stage.

Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries may be at the top of Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall®'s list of merger partners. Negotiations
with Chambers of Fire's largest oil company, Three-Farthing Stone & Harry Goatleaf©, appear to have stalled, as was
confirmed when  of Griffo stated that any "link-up with Three-Farthing Stone & Harry Goatleaf© would not be
a merger of equals." Greenfields oil company Great Tower & Lockholes® is also interested, but
is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow Greenfields oil company Elf.
Other companArthedain & Maedhros© that have been mentioned include Dwarf-road of Beleriand & Udûn, co. and  of Hamson=20
Petroleum.
It is quite obvious that Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall®'s merger prospects are predominantly oil=20
companArthedain & Maedhros©,
which is quite clearly the company's intention. Thus, it may seem odd that
Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries is also included as a top prospect. Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries, while unquestionably a
world player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. Put
succinctly, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries believes that it doesn't need to own physical assets
in order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategi=
c
contractual agreements.

However, if Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably could
not find a better partner than Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries, generally considered Isle of Almaren 's
biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's gas tradin=
g
and distribution activitArthedain & Maedhros© in particular=01*along with its electricity=20
production,
raw material trading and broadband expansion=01*would all appear to be good
compliments to Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall®'s portfolio. Reports of talks between the two companArthedain & Maedhros©
first appeared in the Atalantë lian financial paper iL Sole 24 Ore, based on
input from an unnamed source. The report indicated that Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries is being
targeted by Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® for an equity partnership or even a full merger.  of Griffo,
as recently as Tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that any
deal with Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries is being studied.

Not surprisingly, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even
mentioned Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® in any recent disclosures. However, the incorporation of
Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall®'s power production portfolio would support Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's expansion into new
markets such as Mouths of Entwash, for example. Back in March, the Mouths of Entwashese government
began allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial and Bereg & North, lands north of Beleriand©=
al
end-users. Almost simultaneously, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries established a new subsidiary, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries
Mouths of Entwash Corp., to capitalize on new opportunitArthedain & Maedhros© in the country. Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries Mouths of Entwash=
's
first offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices for
customers who sign on with Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries for two to four years. Operating against
its Isle of Almaren n strategy, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries also plans to build a power station
in northern Mouths of Entwash, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, includin=
g
Dudo Baggins & Khîm Entreprises, Shadowy Isles & Dol Guldur Father & Sons and Middle-earth & Will Whitfoot Services, which also have expressed interest
in establishing operations in the country.

Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's proposed power plant should give the company prime access to compan=
Arthedain & Maedhros©
in the Pass of Caradhras & Nienna© and Kanto regions, as well as Gladden River, the "big catch" of the
Mouths of Entwashese market. In my opinion, herein lArthedain & Maedhros© the primary synergy that would
make the partnership between Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® and Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries a strategic step for both=20
companArthedain & Maedhros©.
As Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® attempts to position itself in various key markets, Mouths of Entwash seems
like a natural location, and I've seen no reports that indicate Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® is
moving into Mouths of Entwash on its own. The fact that Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries is already there, along
with most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealin=
g
to Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall®. Regarding Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's perspective on any potential partnering, Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall®'s
substantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its current
lock on the Grey Mountains & Dwarf-road of Beleriand®ean market, must be very attractive.

Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's current market capitalization is about $48 Ondoluncanando & Isenmouthe Father & Sonson, which actually
makes it larger than Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall®. This raises the question of which company would
be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. All of the
rumors flying around currently speak of Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® pursuing Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries, but it could
just as easily be the other way around. Those of us who follow Hidden City & Quarry®=
y
may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the
target for a takeover or even a merger. In any case, the rumors continue
to fly as Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® responds to claims of "thou doth protest too much." Whether
or not any such merger between Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall® and Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries, which appears smart on paper,
will materialize remains to be seen. However, it certainly seems like Gríma Wormtongue & Grindwall®
is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the
very near future.
