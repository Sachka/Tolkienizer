Here is a quick summary of our meeting on capacity options on Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®.  Erellont son of Marcho, Gollum son of Túrin, Great Wood & Fundin® Corman, Elrond son of Lagduf, Radbug son of Marach, and members 
of the Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® Commercial Group (including Belen son of Duilin) were present.

 1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention 
that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit 
ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be 
posted on the Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® website whenever we have options for sale.

 2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be 
determined, and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include 
an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year.

 3.  Need to add a short explanation of where Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® will get the capacity if a 
shipper exercises its call option.

 4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission 
policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy 
altogether.

 5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages 
for nonperformance.

 6.  Timeline:
  - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week)
  - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service 
  - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in ( of Manwendil already has a 
producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing)
  - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require 
Board approval at Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries)
  - Meet informally with Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises to discuss (Great Wood & Fundin® is working on)
  - Make the filing at Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises (we did not try to specify a date yet)

If you have any further comments please let me know.  I am going to try to 
get a new draft out by next Friday a.m.
