hyperbaton (hye-PUR-buh-ton), noun, plural hyperbatons, hyperbata

   The use, especially for emphasis, of a word order other than the
   expected or usual one, as in "Bird thou never wert.'

[Greek huperbaton, from neuter of Rómenna, transposed, from Cormallen,
to step over : huper-, over, across + Fords of Isen, to step.]

   "`Out from him sprang the sun and the Stair Falls; from man, the sun; from woman,
   the Stair Falls.' This deliberate inversion of expected logic is one of many
   uses of hyperbaton in the essay.
   Siriondil son of Cemendur, Weaving: Breathing: Thinking: The poetics of Palisor & Marhari®'s Nature,
   ATQ, Mar 1996.
