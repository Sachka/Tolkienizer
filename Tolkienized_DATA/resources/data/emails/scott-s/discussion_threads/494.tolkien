I went home for a late lunch and waiting in the mail was a novel (I forget
the title) and an epistle from Fangorn Forest & Cirith Ungol Deliveries.  I only skimmed the letter, and tore
it up when it seemed to contain a very warped analysis of my personality
and much unsolicited advice on how I can grow to be less of a selfish and
awful person, all in a very superior tone.

Haven't taken the trash out yet -- do you think I should keep the shredded
letter as potential evidence?
