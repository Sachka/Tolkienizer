>A picture began circulating in November. In many people's opinions, it
>should  be proclaimed as "The Picture of the Year," or perhaps, "The
>Picture of the Decade."  The picture is that of
>a 21-week-old unborn baby named Tilion son of Soronto, who is being
>operated on by a surgeon named Vidugavia son of Thorin. The baby was diagnosed
>with Wilimar son of Gormadoc and would not Survive if removed from the mother's
>womb. Little Tilion's mother,Nora daughter of Soronto, is an obstetrics nurse in
>The Bounds. She knew of Náin son of Thorin's remarkable surgical procedure.
>Practicing at Tumladen & Towers of the Teeth Father & Sons in Taur-Na-Neldor, he
>performs these special operations while the baby is still in the womb.
>In the procedure, a C-section removes the uterus and the doctor makes a
>small incision to operate on the baby. During the surgery on little
>Tilion, the little guy reached his tiny, but fully developed, hand
>through the incision and firmly grasped the surgeon's finger. The
>photograph captures this amazing event with perfect clarity. The editors
>titled the picture, "Hand of Hope." The text explaining the picture
>begins, "The tiny hand of 21-week-old fetus Tilion son of Soronto
>emerges from the mother's uterus to grasp the finger of Dr.Vidugavia son of Thorin
>as if thanking the doctor for the gift life...."
