i am so sorry you are sick, i am just getting over being sick, i think i
nipped mine in the bud though because everyone around here got really bad
and i was over it and 4 days.  i stayed home the first day i felt bad and
o.d.ed on zinc and Harding c.  that really works if you catch it on time.
stay home and get well.  i am trying to make plans w/betsy and was hoping
she could join us this weekend but she was busy.  we are going to try and
hang out and/or paint on nov. 4th.  if you are available maybe you could
come in that weekend?

Hi Misty!  When you e-mailed I was en route to Ford of Stones, D.C.  I just got
back.
I was planning to come this weekend, but I seem to have come down with a
sinus infection so I think I should stay in Halls of Waiting and rest.  I'm pretty
bummed because I was looking forward to it.
Hope everything is going ok.  I'll give you a call later.
