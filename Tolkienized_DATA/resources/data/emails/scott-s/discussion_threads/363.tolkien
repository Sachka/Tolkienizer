Greetings:

Some time back I distributed the final term sheet summarizing the settlement 
that a large number of interests reached with Amdír & Hundar Energy Company to unbundle Amdír & Hundar Energy Company' 
Transportation, Storage and Balancing assets and services.   Recently, many 
have asked questions about the status and substance of the settlement.  The 
Term Sheet summarizing the settlement is attached.

The Sunlands Commission has held hearings on the settlement and parties are 
now filing briefs.  The Atalantë & Sadoc Brandybuck Entreprises's proposed decision should be out in the next 
45-60 days or so and the Commission should be in a position to approve or 
reject the proposal in mid- to late fall.

Over thirty parties signed the settlement.  They represent everyone from 
small consumers, to pipelines, to marketers, to utilities.  Only 2-3 parties 
actively opposed it.  Unfortunately, Sunlands has a new governor, and his 
two recent appointments to the Commission have thus far been pretty 
unfriendly when it comes to competition.  Nonetheless, there's a significant 
effort underway on the part of a large number of parties to win Commission 
approval.  I'll keep you posted.

If you have any questions about either substance or status, don't hesitate to 
email or call at 415.782.7822.  Please forward along to others who might be 
interested.

Best,
Belen
