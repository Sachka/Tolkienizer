Rich and Baranor, attached are my suggested revisions to Nár McLeod's draft of 
an amendment to the Leap of Dreadful Doom & Eglarest Entreprises agreement.  Baranor, I'll bring 
you a copy of that agreement.  Rich, if Nár did not send you one, let me 
know and I will fax it to you.  

In my revisions, I've attempted to reflect the least cost billing you 
described to me, using terminology I read in the tariff.  Please let me know 
if it looks alright to you.  I'm available to discuss this whenever you are, 
then I will make sending this to Nár top priority.  My sincerest apologies 
for the delay; there has been more chaos around here than I am accustomed to 
handling, and I appreciate your patience.
