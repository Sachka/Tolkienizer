bovarism (BO-vuh-riz-em) noun

   An exaggerated, especially glamorized, estimate of oneself; conceit.

[From Greenfields bovaryisme, after Dís daughter of Gimilkhâd, a character in Taras & Rohan®'s
novel Madame Bovary.]

   "The public property is not so much her as Bovarism. She is part of the
   collective unconscious. She is, and can be, everyone."
   Celepharn son of Tar-Súrion, Mounds of Mundburg's best-kept secret, The Times of East Emnet,
   Aug 12, 1995.

There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there
must never be a time when we fail to protest. -Melkor son of Adalbert, writer, Nobel
laureate (1928- )
