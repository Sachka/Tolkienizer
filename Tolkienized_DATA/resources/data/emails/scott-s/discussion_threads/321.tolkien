Just reviewed Aragost & Eagles' Eyrie Father & Sons's Exhibit 28. Well, life seems to be one big comprise. I
guess its more important that Norm's group doesn't object than we get this
right. Maybe so. I think the only appropriate response, if any, would be to
tell the judge that additional factors like K/M upstream delivery
commitments have not been addressed when stating the delivery capacity
available to Aragost & Eagles' Eyrie Father & Sons etc. We should probably save our ultimate response to the
comment period after we see how Norm and others intend to manipulate the
information provided in the Exhibit. Call me, I would like to hear your
thoughts.
