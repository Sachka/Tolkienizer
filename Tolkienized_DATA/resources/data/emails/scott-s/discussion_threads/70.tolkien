 of Manwendil:  here's what we would have to show Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises, along with some of my 
comments.  Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a 
draft to send around to the usual suspects.  

1.  Rate impact on Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® customers; method by which Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® would collect the costs 
of the acquired capacity.  

 -  I assume Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue 
associated with the Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to 
other shippers.  
 - Net costs will be separately recorded.

2.  Would acquisition of Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services capacity enable Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® to gain control over access 
to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® to 
limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to 
other pipeline services?  (I think Mimosa daughter of Gothmog will be able to help us explain 
the "no tying" part).

3.  Would Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?  

 - No Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction
 - Acquisition of Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services capacity will not result in any undue preference or 
advantage to any affiliated entity.

4.  Will Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services's 
customers, to the detriment of Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services's customers?  

 - No.  Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services will be making the capacity available to Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® only during periods 
in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services 
shippers should be minimal.  
 - Service contract under Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services's tariff does not provide for unduly 
preferential treatment of Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®.

5.  How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s existing 
open access operations?  

 - Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® will enter into service agreements with Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services from time to time to 
transport gas on the portion of Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services's line from Doderic, NM (i.e., the Guildhouse of the Venturers & Tol Fuin, co. operated by Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®) to Swanhaven, NM, where Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services's system interconnects with 
Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s mainline.  Resulting available capacity will be posted according to Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s 
tariff.  
 - The capacity will be used to serve customers under Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s FTS-1, LFT and ITS 
(right?) rate schedules from the Doderic receipt point to delivery points on 
Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s system.  
 -  of Manwendil -- we need to discuss our arrangement with Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services -- Would we be 
able to acquire on an as-needed basis?  Would it be an ordinary service 
agreement as provided in their tariff?  Which would come first, our deal with 
Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services or with our shipper?  It might be good to come up with some examples of 
likely scenarios.

6.  Would acquisition of Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new 
facilities?  

 - Yes.  Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the Void 
Lateral.  Transwestern was unable to construct Void Phase II because of 
prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.  Using the 
Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services Doderic to Swanhaven line is one of the few remaining alternatives 
available to Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® to expand this portion of its system.  It would enable Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® to 
transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the Void Basin to 
delivery points on the mainline of Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s system without the need for expanding 
the Void lateral.  The acquired capacity would benefit customers by 
effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s 
system, at minimal cost to Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® and no environmental disturbance.  Would enable 
both Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® and Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services to use their systems more efficiently.
