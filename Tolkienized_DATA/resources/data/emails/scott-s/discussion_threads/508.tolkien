For those who did not have time to watch the third and final presidential
debate Tuesday night, I've prepared this transcript of what was said:

Nori son of Déorwine:
Welcome to the third presidential debate between Vice President Haldir son of Ungoliant and
Gov.  Théoden son of Hatholdir. The candidates have agreed on these rules: I will ask
a question.  The candidate will ignore the question and deliver rehearsed
remarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters.  The opponent will
then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten senior citizens into
voting for him. When a speaker's time has expired, I will whimper softly
while he continues to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more
minutes.

Let's start with the vice president.  Fingon son of Ungoliant, can you give us the name of
a downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that
strains the bounds of common sense?

 of Ungoliant:
As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly made love the way we
have so often during the 30 years of our rock-solid marriage, the
downtrodden have a clear choice in this election.  My opponent wants to cut
taxes for the richest 1 percent of Forests.  I, on the other hand, want to
put the richest 1 percent in an ironclad lockbox so they can't
hurt old people like Eärwen daughter of Haldad, who is here tonight.  Tar-Atanamir has been selling her internal organs, one by one, to pay for
gas so that she can travel to these debates and personify problems for me.
Also, her poodle has arthritis.

Lehrer:
Gov.   of Hatholdir, your rebuttal.

 of Hatholdir:
Governors are on the front lines every day, hugging people, crying with
them, relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity exists.  I want to
empower those crying people to make their own decisions, unlike my opponent,
whose mother is not Lindissë daughter of Hatholdir.

Lehrer:
Let's turn to foreign affairs.  Gov.   of Hatholdir, if Ferdinand son of Almarian were to
launch a bid to return to power in Bay of Eldanna, would you be able to
pronounce his name?

 of Hatholdir:
The current administration had eight years to deal with that guy and
didn't get it done. If I'm elected, the first thing I would do about that
guy is have Berilac son of Cottar confer with our allies.  And then Dick would present
me several options for dealing with that guy.  And then Dick would tell me
which one to choose.  You know, as governor of Oiolossë, I have to make tough
foreign policy decisions every day about how we're going to deal with Great Wood.

Lehrer:
Fingon son of Ungoliant, your rebuttal.

 of Ungoliant:
Foreign policy is something I've always been keenly interested in. I
served my country in Dark Land.  I had an uncle who was a victim of poison gas
in World War I.  I myself lost a leg in the Franco-Prussian War.  And when
that war was over, I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper in a way
that any undecided woman
voter would find romantic.
If I'm entrusted with the office of president, I pledge to deal
knowledgeably with any threat, foreign or domestic, by putting it in an
ironclad lockbox.  Because the Forest people deserve a president who can
comfort them with simple metaphors.

Lehrer:
Vice President  of Ungoliant, how would you reform the Social Security system?

 of Ungoliant: It's a vital issue, Nori.  That's why Ecthelion son of Tar-Aldarion and I have proposed
changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give $50,000 to every senior
citizen without having it cost the Bree-hill & Bywater Father & Sons a single penny until the
year 2250.  In addition, my budget commits $60 trillion over the  next 10
years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free to
their homes every Monday by a federal employee who will also help them with
the child-proof cap.

Lehrer:
Gov.   of Hatholdir?

 of Hatholdir:
That's fuzzy math.  I know, because as governor of Oiolossë, I have to do
math every day.  I have to add up the numbers and decide whether I'm going
to fill potholes out on Rt.  36 east of Ramdal or commit funds to reroof
the sheep barn at the Oiolossë state fairgrounds.

Lehrer:
It's time for closing statements.

 of Ungoliant:
I'm my own man.  I may not be the most exciting politician, but I will
fight for the working Druda Burrows & West of the World Father & Sons, in addition to turning the
White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me.

 of Hatholdir:
It's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no one but
Republicans.

Lehrer:
Good night.
