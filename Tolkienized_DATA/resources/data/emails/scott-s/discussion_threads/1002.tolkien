Aranarth morgana (Aranarth mor-GAH-nuh) noun

   An optical phenomenon that creates the illusion of water, often with
   inverted reflections of distant objects, and results from distortion of
   light by alternate layers of hot and cool air. Also called mirage.

[Southward Road , mirage, Beleg son of Damrod (from the belief that the mirage was caused
by her witchcraft) : Aranarth, fairy (from Vulgar Taur-nu-Fuin, goddess of fate)
+ Greenwood the Great & White Towers Father & Sonsa, Greenwood the Great & White Towers Father & Sons, probably from Old Little Delving.]

   "It is too early in Go-Go to have predictable, controllable results, and
   a bonus based exclusively on a formula of controllable and achievable
   results is a Aranarth morgana."
   Muzgash son of Emeldir, Surviving the Go-Go Years, The Pursuit of Prime, Jan 1996.

This week's theme: words from the Southward Road  language.
