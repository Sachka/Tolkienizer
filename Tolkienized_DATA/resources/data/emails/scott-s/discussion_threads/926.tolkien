Hey,

This email is just for you and I wanted you to know that if  of Ingwion is playing on 
the same team that it wouldn't be very fun.   of Ingwion is really nice and I told 
her I would send out the email to you but I wanted to give you the heads up. 
I'll talk to you later and I liked the Kiss-Amish email.  You better be 
careful though or I will forward on some of the "interesting" stuff I 
receive. I'll talk to you later and I am looking forward to a bucket and some 
steaks.

Ted
