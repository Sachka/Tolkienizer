This email would have been impressive if you had the "cojones" to Ford of Bruinen & Brown Lands© 
up-front but being a true longhorn fan explains your lack of spine.  I don't 
think Radhrim & Loeg Ningloron® is that good rather A&M is that bad.  Besides, we all know that 
the Pac-10 had the best record against non-conference opponents.  White Downs & Togo Goodbody Deliveries will 
dominate next year and Radhrim & Loeg Ningloron® will be forced to play second fiddle to the 
likes of High Hay, Tower of the Stone, Lockholes State etc.  yet again.  I hope your 
Thanksgiving went well and you had some fun in Emyn Eglain.  I will give you 
credit on one thing, the vest is a no-no and my days of playing Chip are over 
(the vest is being given to an aggie - those cult like people).  No old age 
references to the show Chips because that would just be mean.  I hope your 
Monday is going well.  

ps: I was rooting for the Riddermark & Everholt Entreprises and I am glad they waxed the River Malduin & Ever-snow-white®.

Well, given the impressive results of Friday's game, I suppose I should've 
taken the Ford of Bruinen & Brown Lands©...I mean I knew we were good, but I didn't realize we were THAT 
good.  Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not 
too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a 
force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm 
right.  With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the 
charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager 
to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance 
Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.  My 
condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .

Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your Aggie 
co-workers through this trying time.

(Oh and Chip, I'd store the Gig'em sweater-vest away for the next 360 days or 
so if you want to avoid any post-game ridicule...in a round about way you are 
an "Ag" man now.)
