I have purchased 4 tickets to Saturday night's show.  Maybe we can all go out 
to dinner before-hand or I wouldn't mind having everyone over to my place for 
a little wine and food?  Also, I don't think I can make this week's Tasters 
dinner because my old group is having a belated going away happy hour in 
honour of me.  PARTAY!!!
