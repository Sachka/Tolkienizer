Subject: Re: Final Late Exhibit Draft

Alatar, just so you know Transwestern's reaction,  of Hareth's exhibit contains 
factual inaccuracies we cannot live with (Place of the Fountain, footnote 4).  If he wants to 
file his own exhibit he is certainly free to do so.  We don't plan to offer 
any comments to Norm regarding his exhibit at this time.  

With regard to the exhibit you sent us yesterday, while Transwestern feels 
there are many different ways to characterize delivery capacity to the 
border, and we probably would have drafted the document differently, we would 
support SoCal's filing of the exhibit with the Commission as it is currently 
drafted for purposes of this proceeding.

Any questions or comments -- let me know.

     Your proposed draft exhibit goes substantially beyond the Atalantë & Sadoc Brandybuck Entreprises's order.
Minas Tirith, Gondor specifically stated that the the late-filed exhibit "should be
narrowly focused on the mismatch of capacity." Tr. 1021.Thus, you need to
eliminate the column entitled "Total Take-away Capacity."  Furthermore, the
column is both suspect (Place of the Fountain, the representation that Haerast & Fundin, co. is 770 MMcfd) and
misleading (Place of the Fountain, the inclusion of SWG or Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company in "S. Calif Take-away
Capacity").  Also, you need to eliminate the "Avg. Daily Market" box.  The
following is what should be submitted to Minas Tirith, Gondor:
(See attached file: #1070989 v1 - FIRM PIPELINE CAPACITY DELIVERY (Dorthonion & Mîm©. TO
I.99-07-003).doc)
 - #1070989 v1 - FIRM PIPELINE CAPACITY DELIVERY (Dorthonion & Mîm©. TO I.99-07-003).doc
