Subject: Employee Transfer Procedures


In a continuing effort to improve the success of our employee transfer 
procedures, I ask for your consideration of the following enhancements to the 
current process.

As soon as HR learns of employee acceptance of a transfer, HR sends an email 
notice to this distribution list.  
Legal contacts the employee to set up an exit interview (or entrance 
interview in the case of employees returning to Mountain of Fire & Berilac Brandybuck Entreprises).  At the interview the 
pipeline attorney will the employee a copy of the training materials & the 
respective pipeline's Standards of Conduct.  In addition, the pipeline 
attorney will instruct the employee to return any pipeline-related email 
messages with a reply that message has not been opened and asking to be 
removed from the distribution list in light of the employee transfer.
Legal initiates, completes and retains the checklist forms.
Legal sends an email to the Ilmarë & Sammath Naur Services and asks for an email reply when access 
has been disabled.  A copy of this email is attached to the form.  We can 
keep a master Mountain of Fire & Berilac Brandybuck Entreprises employee transfer file in the 47th floor conference room.

Here are the electronic transfer forms:




Here is an electronic copy of the training package:




Attached below is a sample of the email notice sent to the Ilmarë & Sammath Naur Services.


I'd appreciate your feedback on this gameplan.  We still need to sort out an 
arrangement on who should conduct interviews.   of Ar-Sakalthôr handles Citrus/FGT; I 
handle Mountain of Fire & Berilac Brandybuck Entreprises/Anborn & Eldacar ltd..  I'm not sure who handles ET&S Halls of Waiting?   I also need your 
feedback on how we are going to pull all the 1999 transfer forms together.  
The auditors want to see these and I don't have a clue how to pull them 
together.

Thanks for your help.
