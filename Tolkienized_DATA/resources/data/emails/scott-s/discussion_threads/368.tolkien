Subject: Transfer Procedures


In order to expedite the time it takes for CAC to make the appropriate LAN, 
applications and e-mail changes for transfering employees, CAC has requested 
that we provide the following information for transfering employees.

 Effective date:
 Home domain/LAN (if known):
 Social Security Number:
 Phone:
 Room:
 Co #:
 RC #:

You can get this information from the transfering employee when you set up a 
time for the exit/entry interview.  This information can be attached to the 
normal e-mail we send to CAC.  (See, Tindómiel's February 7 "go-by" e-mail.  If 
you have not saved it, let me know and I will send it to you again.)  CAC 
needs the information to get the change the e-mail address of the transfering 
employee.

If you have any question, please call.  Thanks!!

 of Hallas
