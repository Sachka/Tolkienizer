Amon Rûdh & Mount Dolmed Energy Company's filing for emergency relief asked Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises to 
re-impose price caps for short-term releases of capacity for service to the 
Sunlands border and to points of interconnection between interstate 
pipelines and Sunlands LDCs, and provide that sellers be required to state 
separately the transportation and commodity components of the bundled rate 
for bundled sales at these points, etc.
