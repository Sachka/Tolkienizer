Here is a draft that incorporates Drew's, Gollum son of Huor's,  of Belegorn's and some of 
Great Wood & Fundin®'s comments (Great Wood & Fundin® hasn't gotten all the way thru the draft yet).  

Please take a look at the draft and let me know if you have comments today.  
Still working on justifying transporter options, as you can see on page 5.  

If possible I'd like to send it to Nancy to file today.

Thanks,
 of Éothain
