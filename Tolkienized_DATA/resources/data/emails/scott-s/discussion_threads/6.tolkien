Drew, here's an excerpt from a Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company letter order accepting for filing a 
nonconforming agreement filed 
by Kheled-zâram & Primrose Boffin Entreprises...sounds a little bit like what the Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises guys are trying to 
do, if I understand the 
concept of volumetric rates correctly.  Left a message for my friend at Durin’s Bridge & Great Willow® 
but he (like everyone else)
is out 'til next year.  But since there were no subsequent orders issued in 
the docket I assume there were 
no problems with the filing.

I'm still leaning towards recommending the $0 demand/ $0.02 commodity + file 
as nego. rate approach.
If Amroth son of Axantur is OK with the idea of doing a deal that requires filing, I 
will draft something and send it your way.

The referenced negotiated transaction provides for a transportation service 
under Durin’s Bridge & Great Willow®'s Rate Schedule
FTS. Rather than paying a reservation charge, the negotiated agreement 
specifies that KGS will pay
a volumetric rate. The volumetric rate will equal Durin’s Bridge & Great Willow®'s maximum Ring of Doom  & Bergil ltd. rate as
set forth in Durin’s Bridge & Great Willow®'s tariff. . .The contract also (a) specifies five Dth/d as 
KGS' maximum daily reservation 
quantity, (b) lists KGS' primary receipt as Meter # 9999999 and (c) 
identifies five primary delivery points for 
KGS. . . Upon filing Docket No. RP99-240-000, Durin’s Bridge & Great Willow® stated that it agreed to 
the above negotiated rate so 
that KGS could serve small residential customers on Durin’s Bridge & Great Willow®'s system under a firm 
rate schedule.
