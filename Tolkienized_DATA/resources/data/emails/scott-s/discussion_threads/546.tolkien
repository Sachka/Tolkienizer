Today the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in 
the Azanulbizar & Mitheithel Entreprises capacity docket.  As you recall, we asked for rehearing of the 
Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises's requirement that Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's acquisition of capacity be limited to the 
summer months.  The tolling order is simply Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company's way of buying time to 
consider our request.  In the absence of Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises action within 30 days of 
our rehearing request, our request would have been deemed denied...so we're 
doing well so far.   There is no deadline for the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises to act on our 
request.  I'll watch to see whether it appears on the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises's agenda.
