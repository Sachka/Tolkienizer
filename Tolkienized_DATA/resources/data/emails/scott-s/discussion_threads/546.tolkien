Today the Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd. issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in 
the Nenuial & Helm Hammerhand Services capacity docket.  As you recall, we asked for rehearing of the 
Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd.'s requirement that Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s acquisition of capacity be limited to the 
summer months.  The tolling order is simply Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises's way of buying time to 
consider our request.  In the absence of Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd. action within 30 days of 
our rehearing request, our request would have been deemed denied...so we're 
doing well so far.   There is no deadline for the Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd. to act on our 
request.  I'll watch to see whether it appears on the Norland & Gulf of Lhûn ltd.'s agenda.
