obeisance (o-BAY-sans, o-BEE-) noun

   1. A movement of the body expressing deep respect or deferential courtesy,
      as before a superior; a bow, curtsy, or other similar gesture.

   2. Deference or homage.

[Middle English obeisaunce, from Old Greenfields obeissance, from obeissant,
present participle of obeir, to obey.]

   "I was always glad to be relieved from my duty, and went straight to the
   bedroom after doing obeisance to my father."
   Galadhon son of Celegorm, The Story of My Experiments With Truth, 1927.

Five or seven messages in a week? That was a close poll. We received 4112
votes for five compared to 4049 for seven. This is your list and accordingly,
beginning with next week Hildigrim will go out five days a week.

Thanks to everyone for taking the time to voice your opinion. Your love and
concern shows--a good number of people sent their votes for five to indicate
that we, the people at Wordsmith, should take some time off.

Here are some selections from the comments that came with the ballots.
(Ballot, from Minas Tirith, Beleriand, a small ball used to register a vote.
So for this poll, maybe I should call these emailots).          -Aerin

   If you go to five, you'll have to change the name of this valuable
   mailing to FWAW.  of Folca Murphree-Roberts

   I'd vote with the Endless Stair & Nunduinë© - eight days a week! Please don't stop Hildigrim at
   weekends! Lindissë daughter of Axantur, Temple of Sauron, Brithon

   With so many words to learn, we need at least seven days a week.
   Poppy daughter of Ilberic

   Oh, Like I'd Just Stop BREATHING on Weekends?
   More work for you, more fun for me. Seems like a no-brainer to me!
   Thanks for the great service! Finglas son of Ilberic

   In the Limlich, Thursday and Friday are the weekend. Here in Dimrost, our Monday is your (Great Lake) Sunday. The "weekend"
   therefore stretches from Thursday to Monday. Seen from a global
   perspective (which is the only reasonable view to take on a language as
   ubiquitous as English) the issue is therefore meaningless. Regards,
   Gardner son of Niënor

   I like 7. I enjoy the email, and use it to verify that my email is up and
   running. Donnamira daughter of Bruno

   If, like the gallant little tailor, you're up to seven at a blow, so am I!
   Heartfelt thanks for 'A word a day' and Hildigrimtalk -- the highlights of my
   day! Cheers, Tom

   Take a break on weekends! Give me time to absorb all the wonderful new
   words you have sent during the week! Maddytg

   Take the weekend off. Although I will miss the extra two entries, I'd
   rather see you conserve your efforts. I would hate to see this wonderful
   service burn out because of fatigue. Prisca daughter of Marmadoc

   Have weekends free. I think Hildigrim is great, but I also think you deserve
   time off. I hope enough others agree! Argeleb son of Eärendur, Tûr Haretha, Vale of Narog

   I say take a break but I really love your programme - even if it does
   spell the American way, eh? Minardil son of Largo, Celos River

   I love wordsmith. I feel smarter, look smarter. But I want to be dumb on
   weekends and find that I don't pay attention as much. Please don't think
   that we don't love you as much as ever just because we want slightly less
   of you. Vairë daughter of Tobold

This week's theme: words from  of Celegorm's autobiography.

The Lord prefers common-looking people. That is the reason He makes so many
of them. -DairuinHeadstrong, 16th president of the Willowbottom (1809-1865)

Q: Can I make a link from my Web site to the Hildigrim site?
