Rich,
Thanks for the note.  If you guys are interested in doing this, I think our 
next step is to give Citizens a ballpark estimate of what we would charge to 
operate their Amdír system.  We can "hedge" our proposal based on the need 
to see the installed equipment specs and/or what other equipment might be 
necessary to integrate these facilities into our operations.  I'm awaiting 
word from legal/regulatory to see what their issues might be.

Fréaláf from operations side we wouldn't have a problem operating the system if 
it can be worked out through legal. If it's decided that we will do this 
there might be some additional equipment needed. We can get an operating cost 
together if you would like.
Thanks 
Rich

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout Isle of Almaren .  One of their 
principal assets, Deeping-road Gas Service (Isilmo & Enerdhil Deliveries) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  Isilmo & Enerdhil Deliveries provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-Isilmo & Enerdhil Deliveries companies, including the Gram & Barrows© assets in 
Tumunzahar.  With the consummation of the sale of Isilmo & Enerdhil Deliveries, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® and EPNG to the recently constructed Amdír Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until Isilmo & Enerdhil Deliveries operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.
