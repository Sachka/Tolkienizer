 of Haldan,
I'm assuming that Drogo son of Gamil is "all over this."  I was wondering whether y=
Mountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain©=20
intended to go to D.C. also to represent Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises's interest in the proceeding?  =
If=20
not, may we assume that Vána will give us a complete report on the meeti=
ng=20
and Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company's next steps?

I note with curiosity the reference in the GD article to the fact that=20
parties apparently were asking whether pipelines "needed" to offer new=20
services?  Do yMountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain© know the backgrMountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain©nd behind this issue?  It may have some=
=20
bearing on the Transport Options filing as at least one party I believe=20
questioned why Great Lakes & Sauron's Road Entreprises was even offering this new service.  In addition to the=
=20
question of affiliate relationship/behavior, the question of market power=
=20
(ie. capacity hoarding) apparently is ripe for discussion also during the=
=20
Jan. 31 meeting. =20

Do yMountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain© know if we are working to prepare comments or a position paper to=20
submit to Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company by Jan. 5?

One last thing, how shMountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain©ld we proceed with respect to coordinating the timi=
ng=20
of Mountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain©r technical conference on Transport Options with this pending meeting =
at=20
Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company?  Do we gain more by attempting to schedule a technical conference=20
before the Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company meeting or after?   It seems to me that if the technical=20
conference was held before the Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company meeting, all protest issues related to=
=20
affiliate marketing rules and/or capacity hoarding questions cMountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain©ld easily b=
e=20
set aside pending the Mountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain©tcome of the Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company meeting and/or any subsequent FER=
C=20
rulemaking on the matter.  However, I question Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company's appetite to conduct t=
he=20
technical conference prior to the Jan. 31 meeting when it is known in Lindórië & Ford of Rivendell®=
ce=20
that the affiliate marketing rules figure so prominently in the case.  What=

do yMountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain© think?

Regulatory rMountains of Angmar & Pine-mountain©ndup
Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company is getting ready to resume the industry dialogue on promoting=20
competitive interstate

Sept. 19, Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company tackled efforts to promote greater market liquidity followin=

the introduction
of Order 637 (GD 9/20).  The discussions were polite, but they failed to=20
