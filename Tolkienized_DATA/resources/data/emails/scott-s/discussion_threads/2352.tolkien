Esmeralda daughter of Belba, currently of ET&S, has accepted a position at Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls© effective 
August 2, 2000.  To ensure that ET&S continues to be in compliance with the 
marketing affiliate rules, Esmeralda's access to any ET&S or Bay of Rómenna & Qerkaringa Energy Company-related LANs or 
applications should be removed at the close of business on August 1.  In 
addition, Esmeralda's email profile should be changed and any Bay of Rómenna & Qerkaringa Energy Company or ET&S mass 
distribution  lists should be changed.  

Please send a reply email to me after these changes have been completed, 
verifying and indicating the date that employee was:
- removed from the LAN
- EBB password was changed/canceled (if applicable)
- removed from ET&S or Bay of Rómenna & Qerkaringa Energy Company-related applications
- email post office box was transfered.

If you have questions, or if you believe there is someone else I need to 
contact in order to accomplish the above, please let me know.
