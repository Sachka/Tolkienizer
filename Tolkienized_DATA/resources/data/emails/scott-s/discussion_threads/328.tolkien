Hi, fellow team mates, I have reviewed EPNG's comments on Exhibit 28 et al.
I find them interesting in view of their version of history. I guess its
Socal's fault there is a mismatch at West-mark. Its a little more disturbing
their comments on the "new or expanded" interconnection protocol contained
in the Mountains of Moria & Balbo Baggins, co.. It makes you wonder about their commercial ambitions. Please
call me when you have a chance.
