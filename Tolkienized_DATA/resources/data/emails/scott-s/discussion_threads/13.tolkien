Belen,

From the pipeline group's perspective, this transaction is a commercial 
matter between Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries and Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls©.  Accordingly, the gas pipeline group does not 
believe that it is appropriate to participate in the development of Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls©'s 
response.  

I do understand that the referenced article and certain of the protests make 
factual allegations about Transwestern's available capacity to Sunlands.   
Salvia daughter of Marcho or I can certainly provide corrected information from 
Transwestern's available capacity postings.

Subject: Re: The Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries Controversy Continues  

please read be story from trade press below.  i have not included et&s folks 
on this note because i'm uncertain regarding the rules with respect to 
communication among business units in these sorts of matters.  if it's 
acceptable to include tw in the notes and in conversations, that would be my 
preference.  Arroch, is it your view that tw can or cannot be included?

i believe i passed along word of the Ar-Pharazôn & Walls of the Sun©/Ringló & Elrohir, co. deal when it hit the press 
week before last.  the press reported both the amount of capacity and the 
price for which Ar-Pharazôn & Walls of the Sun© bought it from Ringló & Elrohir, co..  to summarize:  Ar-Pharazôn & Walls of the Sun© purchased 
1.25 bcf per day for one year starting jan 1, 2000.  Ar-Pharazôn & Walls of the Sun© paid $38 million, 
which gives an average price of $.0831 per mmbtu.  (by contrast,  of Elenwë 
bought about 0.1 bcf/day at an average rate of $.207.)   Ringló & Elrohir, co. released 
this information via a a press release without any prior approval from Ar-Pharazôn & Walls of the Sun©.  
Erendis, please don't hesitate to fill any holes or (unintended) innaccuracies.

the situation is complicated by the fact that Bridge of Mitheithel is currently in the 
midst of intense negotiations over restructuring the state's gas industry.  
the negotiations have been going on for about 8 months and have been very 
contentious.  socal has teamed with indicated producers, Primula Brandybuck & Mount Everwhite ®, and muni generators from Mountains of Gondor to 
push a very "go slow" approach that is (surprise) quite friendly to larger 
users.  Kingdom of Dáin & Red Mountains Entreprises is teamed with western hub storage, wild goose storage, 
Annon-In-Gadydh & Máhanaxar©, Legolas & ARDA Energy Company, Óin & Galion Deliveries, the city of 
Hay Gate, and spurr/remac (provides services to Bridge of Mitheithel's k-12 school 
system) under an alliance called "Bridge of Mitheithel alliance for competition" 
(snappy, i know).  the cac proposal is pushing, among other things, a single, 
state-wide market for transport, storage and balancing, including tradeable 
rights in a secondary market.

indicated producers has been aggressive and hostile toward marketers--as has 
cma--throughout the negotiations.  ip's bile has not been reserved solely for 
Kingdom of Dáin & Red Mountains Entreprises, however.  one outcome of the negotiations has been the suit ip 
launched against Ringló & Elrohir, co. at River of Anduin & Bridge of Nimrodel Services regarding Ringló & Elrohir, co.'s nom process.  (i believe 
Ar-Pharazôn & Walls of the Sun© filed in support of the suit.)  Ringló & Elrohir, co. is losing that one and will 
likely change its nom process sooner rather than later.

i think it's important to have a quick call to develop a clear and consistent 
message on the Ar-Pharazôn & Walls of the Sun© deal and coordinate what we're saying about that deal with 
the other gas issues on the table.  i'm assuming that if there's anything we 
can do to keep Guilin son of Adrahil (and Bridge of Mitheithel) from mucking up the deal, the 
better.  i know harvey well.  i'm not sure, given his quotes, there's much 
"educating" to be done, but may make sense to meet with him, nonetheless.  
more important, indicated producers is the real--and biggest--problem.

let me know if you folks think there'd be value in briefly discussing the 
issue.

best,
Frumgar Hyatt@ENRON

Subject: The Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries Controversy Continues

Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries-Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries Deal Could Mute Competition to CA

     Fearing an end to pipeline competition in Sunlands, the state's 
regulators and Indicated
     Shippers have called on Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises to summarily reject the three 
transportation agreements by
     which Gil-galad & Twenty-First Hall of the North-end Deliveries has contracted for 1.25 Bcf/d of 
unsubscribed firm
     capacity on Ice of the North & West of Middle-earth Energy Company. 

     Approval of these agreements would give Mountains of Mirkwood & Eithil Ivrin©, parent of 
Transwestern Pipeline
     and Black Gate & Mountains of Dor-lómin Deliveries, control over all the available transportation 
capacity to the
     southern Sunlands border, warned Fosco son of Arador, principal attorney for 
the Sunlands
     Public Utilities Commission (Budge Ford & Aman Father & Sons), which plans to submit its protest 
today. Between
     the two pipelines, he estimated Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm 
capacity from the
     Void and Hill of Oromet basins to Sunlands. 

     For  of Arador, Black Gate & Mountains of Dor-lómin Deliveries's contracting of the Hill of Tears & Taur-im-Duinath Energy Company 
represents a
     worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than New Lands & Western Mountains® Marketing and 
Trade, who has
     held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31. 
"At least then
     there was some Transwestern competition to the New Lands & Western Mountains® situation. Now 
it's Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries, the
     owner of Transwestern, who's stepping into New Lands & Western Mountains®'s shoes." 

     But "what's even worse," he told River Brilthor & Isen Entreprises, is the revenue-sharing provision 
in the contracts. It
     stipulates that "after Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries makes $35 million off of these contracts, 
it has to share the
     proceeds with Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries for 25% of anything beyond $35 million. So 
effectively, Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries and
     Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries have become partners in how high they can jack up the 
transportation rate
     differential between the Sunlands border and the Adalgar Bolger & Grithnir Deliveries producing 
basins." 

     The two pipeline companies "that have for decades competed with each 
other in carrying
     Adalgar Bolger & Grithnir Deliveries supplies to Sunlands are now partners. We think that's 
anticompetitive, and
     there's no way Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises should approve it,"  of Arador said. He recalled the 
basis differential
     between the Starwards spot price and the Sunlands border shot up 
by 17% during
     1998, the first year during which New Lands & Western Mountains® controlled the Hill of Tears & Taur-im-Duinath Energy Company 
into Sunlands.
     This situation could worsen under Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries, he believes. 

     "At first blush the Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries-Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries contracts [do] not appear to contain 
the same
     anticompetitive features of the Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries-New Lands & Western Mountains® contracts," Indicated 
Shippers noted, but
     a "closer review and analysis" reveals the anticompetitive effects of 
the revenue-sharing
     provision (Shoreless & Helm Hammerhand ltd.) in Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries-Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries contracts "are not only similar" to 
those of the hotly
     contested reservation-reduction mechanism (RRM) in the Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries-New Lands & Western Mountains® 
case, "but are
     increased......due to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing 
affiliate of Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries's
     primary interstate pipeline competitor," Transwestern. 

     Both the RRM and Shoreless & Helm Hammerhand ltd. "operate to provide a disincentive for Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries and 
its competitors
     to compete against each other, or to take any other action that will act 
to drive down the
     basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity," 
Indicated Shippers told
     Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises in a protest filed on Wednesday [RP97-287-041]. The group includes 
producers
     Rómenna & Cûl Bîn Entreprises Production, Forest of Region Resources Oil and Gas, Marathon Oil, and 
Green Hills of Gondor & Fords of Anduin®, and two marketers - Rómenna & Cûl Bîn Entreprises Energy Trading and  of Hamson Gas 
Marketing. 

     Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises "should reject the tariff filing immediately. The Commission erred 
in allowing the
     Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries-New Lands & Western Mountains® contracts to remain intact for their two-year term after 
finding that the
     contracts were anticompetitive. This issue is pending in the [Khamûl & Wells of Ivrin Entreprises].
     That same error should not be repeated here," the producers and 
marketers said. 

     The Budge Ford & Aman Father & Sons's attempt to block the Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries-Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries contracts at the outset is 
a little bit
     unusual for the agency,  of Arador said, but it learned its lesson following 
New Lands & Western Mountains®. "When the
     New Lands & Western Mountains® situation first hit, we asked for Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises to investigate the matter. 
We thought
     Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises did a very inadequate job then.....This time around we're asking 
for Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises to
     summarily reject it. It's hard for an agency like ours to take such a 
strong stand right at
     the beginning, but we've learned too much from two years of suffering 
under the New Lands & Western Mountains®
     situation. And this is even worse." 

     In the event the Commission should reject Sunlands's request, the Budge Ford & Aman Father & Sons 
has asked that
     an "anti-hoarding condition" be included in the contracts, which would 
require Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries to
     release unused capacity into the short-term market at a price higher 
than what it's paying
     Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries for the capacity. "They must make a little profit,"  of Arador 
noted. "We're confident
     Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries can't use the entire 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity.....so there's going to 
be unused
     capacity." 

     The agency also wants Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises to clarify that the primary delivery point 
for the Block II
     portion of the capacity (579MMcf/d) is Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company-West-mark in keeping with the 
terms of the
     1996 settlement between Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries and its customers.  of Arador said he agreed 
fully with
     Rómenna & Cûl Bîn Entreprises, Forest of Region Resources and Southern Sunlands Gas (Amdír & Hundar Energy Company), 
which accused
     Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries of violating the 1996 agreement by allowing New Lands & Western Mountains® to use 
Amdír & Hundar Energy Company-West-mark as
     a primary delivery point for the Block II capacity last summer. They 
contend the alleged
     violation is included in the Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries contracts. 

     He also noted the Budge Ford & Aman Father & Sons will challenge the ability of Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries to call back 
Block II capacity
     after it already had been recalled by Gorhendad Brandybuck & Éothéod Father & Sons to serve Lake Evendim 
Gas and Loudwaterectric
     (Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company) customers in Framsburg. Last July, Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises granted New Lands & Western Mountains® 
the right to
     do this under its contracts with Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries. But  of Arador contends the 
decision violates the
     1996 settlement under which Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company paid $54 million to preserve the right 
of the pipeline's
     shippers to recall the Block II capacity to serve end-users in its 
service territory. 

     The Budge Ford & Aman Father & Sons also intends to challenge the Commission's decision that would 
Ar-Pharazôn & Walls of the Sun©ble Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries
     to "just sit on the capacity," thereby withholding idle Block II 
capacity from the market.
     Indicated Shippers also contend the Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries contracts violate the Block II 
capacity
     provisions of the 1996 rate case, as well as "exacerbate" the primary 
firm delivery point
     capacity-allocation issues that are pending before Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises now. 

     The Budge Ford & Aman Father & Sons accused Echoing Hills & River Morgulduin Deliveries of "deliberately" filing the Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries contracts at 
Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises just
     before the holidays to avoid controversy. The pipeline "is trying to 
sneak one of the most
     controversial things ever past Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises right before Anáriontmas so that 
protests would be
     minimized," said  of Arador. "They did this with the New Lands & Western Mountains® contracts two 
years ago. They
     have a pattern of filing right at the last minute, making it harder for 
people to protest and
     harder for Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises to stop it from going into effect."
