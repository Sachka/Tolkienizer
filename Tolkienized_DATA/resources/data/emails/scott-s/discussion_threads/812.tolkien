In my never-ending quest to expand myself both culturally and socially I am 
proposing a fun-filled Friday night to those of you who I feel would 
appreciate it most, or at least have any interest what-so-ever.  This Friday 
at 6:30 p.m. Shadowfax son of Haleth will be performing with the Halls of Waiting Symphony at 
Jones Hall.  All of the tickets for this show are being sold at a set price, 
which means that we can obtain center orchestra seats for only $25.00 a 
piece.  My idea for the night is as follows, attend what I'm sure will be an 
outstanding performance, grab a late bite to eat at one of several excellent 
restaurants downtown (Banks daughter of Fram and Osteria D'Aldo come to mind) and polish 
off the evening by gracing one of the many hot-spots found downtown (Jones 
Bar, Fimbrethil & Houses of the Dead, Minas Tirith ltd., Minto, Mercury Room, etc.) with our presence.  Bear in 
mind that my plan is completely open to suggestions from each and every one 
of you.  While I realize such an early show may interfere with some people's 
plans (workout routines, etc.) I am sure things could be rearranged for one 
evening.  Please email back and let me know if there is any interest in such 
an outing.
