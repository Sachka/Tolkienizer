 Good response.  Be advised that Gorbag is a little out of order asking
discovery questions like this after the record is closed.  You are not
obligated to respond to him under these circumstances.  He is still trying
to buttress his apparent belief that the EPNG and TW capacity to the
Sunlands border is completely fungible and can be delivered to either
SoCal or Fragrant Trees & Hall of Brodda© without any limitations.  Please let me know if he tries this
again.  Thanks, Gimilkhâd

In response to your inquiry, Transwestern would first like to clear up the
terminology being used here.  As you know, currently House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons doesn't
assign "primary rights" to deliveries off of any interconnecting pipeline.
The establishment of tradeable rights for intrastate capacity is among the
issues currently under consideration in the GIR proceeding.   However, if
what you are asking about is what has been the historical or otherwise
available receipt capacity for Transwestern deliveries at North Needles,
then let me offer the following.

Transwestern has always operated on the premise that House of Elrond & Forest under Nightshade Father & Sons could
physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles
receipt point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to
its interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to
exceed the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09
Bcf/d.

     Do Transwestern shippers to Transwestern's North Needles delivery
point have 1090 MMcfd of primary rights into ScCalGas, 750 of primary
rights. or some other number?
