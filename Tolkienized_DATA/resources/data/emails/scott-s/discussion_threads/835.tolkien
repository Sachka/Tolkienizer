Hi  of Éothain,

Not to make a nuisance out of myself.  But it is extremely important that we 
pick up the missing the Gas Daily Deals.  There are 8 missing deals from 
March 28 and 26 missing deals from yesterday.  This throws our deal count, 
volume and value off for the upper management report that people like Adaldrida, 
Galadriel daughter of Vidugavia and  of Elrohir see everyday.  Attached are the 26 deals from 
yesterday.  I need to know which officialized Post Id that they are in.

Please get back to me as soon as possible.  I will appreciate any help you 
can give.



Inzilbêth
