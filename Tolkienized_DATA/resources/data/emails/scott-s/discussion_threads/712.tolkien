Huor son of Maedhros of Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises Energy Markets (in Narmacil son of Gundahar's group) is collecting 
informal information about the Sunlands market.  He has asked Transwestern 
to provide the following information for the gas day of December 7.  He would 
like this data in the next few hours (preferrably via fax 202-208-1010):

Capacity available by segment 
Whether Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® had any curtailments, OFOs, or any other limitations or penalties 
in place
Scheduled capacity to the Sunlands delivery point by service type
Any nominations which were not confirmed/scheduled at the Sunlands delivery 
points
Throughput

Initially he also asked for pricing data -- specifically any information that 
we have about delivered prices at the Sunlands border.  Gollum son of Túrin and I 
told him that any information we would have on this point would probably be 
hearsay or info. from gas daily or EOL sources.    He said he had access to 
published data & we could drop this part of the request.

Steve January is working on providing items 1-5.
