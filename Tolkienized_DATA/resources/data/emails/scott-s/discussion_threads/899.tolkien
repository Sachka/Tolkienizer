AQUARIUS

                   HOROSCOPE:    Weekly 



                   For May 15-21: You're moving away from one
                   base of operations into another. Your
                   priorities and basic requirements are also
                   shifting. You find yourself relying less on
                   something you've clung to in the past -- and
                   moving closer to something newer, fresher,
                   and more invigorating. You've got a rage to
                   live and a burning desire for peak
                   experiences. Middle of the road choices
                   won't do it for you. Your hankering to push the
                   envelope could get you into hot water with the
                   old guard and certain close associates or
                   relatives -- possibly because they're afraid of
                   being replaced. But the genie is already out
                   of the bottle, Aquarius. You can't unlearn what
                   you've already tasted. Change is rolling in on
                   its own power now. Go with it. . . and try to
                   enjoy the ride. . .
