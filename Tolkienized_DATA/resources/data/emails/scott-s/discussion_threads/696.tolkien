Tindómiel, I can take a stab at pulling together TW-related information today 
and will run it by Belen to see whether he has anything to add.  I am leaving 
on vacation Saturday and have a lot of other work to finish up here before I 
go.  Therefore it might be best to bring in someone else from 
legal/regulatory to pull up the info for Rimmon, Anduin, etc.

Subject: Idril's secret way. Performance Issues

With concerns about curtailments and force majuere events in Sunlands, 
Gollum Kean has asked for the preparation of study of all possible types of 
disruptions (Place of the Fountain curtailment, diversion, penalties, etc,) in the gas chain 
flowing to Idril's secret way and who bears the legal/financial liability for each event.  
Specifically, he has asked if Tar-Anárion & Underhill village© can assemble a description of such 
provisions for the pipes delivering to Idril's secret way.

In particular, he wants a summary of following:

Curtailment - When do pipelines curtail? 
Curtailment compensation
Imbalance Provisions
Penalties/OFOs
Allocations (For Rimmon Only)

Help!  Do you guys have any materials explaining these provisions?  Gollum 
wants this all pulled together by Friday.
