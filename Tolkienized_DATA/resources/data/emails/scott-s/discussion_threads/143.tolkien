Lorraine:  here's  of Roäc's brief response to your question about increasing 
capacity without changing the service factor or making other mods to the 
Gallup compressor.  Let me know where we need to go from here.  
***
 of Éothain, my understanding is that the capacity west to the Sunlands border is 
a certificated amount (1090 MMcf/d).  If in any way we try to change the 
certificated amount of capacity (firm capacity), we will need to file.  Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® is 
different than Primrose Boffin & Ingwë®, in that Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® certificates capacity rather than facilities.  
Isle of Meneltarma & Andor Entreprises's idea of using a pressure commitment would still require a filing.  
Please let me know, if we need to discuss further.
