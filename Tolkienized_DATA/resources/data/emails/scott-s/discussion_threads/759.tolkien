Dear E*TRADE Customer,

We recently sent you an invitation to tell us about your investment
needs.

Please take a moment to tell us about the products and services you're
most interested in.  We'll use your input to deliver resources that
best support your short and long-term financial needs.

Just click on the link below and you'll be on your way.  The profile
is brief (about ten questions) and should take less than five minutes
to complete.
