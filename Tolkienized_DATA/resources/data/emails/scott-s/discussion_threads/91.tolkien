 of Arvedui Gateway has a provision in the Negotiated Rates section of its tariff 
that allows  of Arvedui to charge a lump-sum option fee.  Neither the tariff nor the 
Tûr Haretha & Andróg Energy Company order approving the provision describes the option fee in much detail.  
The Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises did require  of Arvedui to separately state any option fee 
arrangements when making its negotiated rate filings for deals that include 
option fees.  The Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises also stressed that an option fee annot guarantee 
capacity and therefore does not amount to a request for transportation 
service.

 of Arvedui has made three negotiated rate filings involving option fees.  In the 
first such filing,  of Arvedui explained that the proposed negotiated rates were 
comprised of two parts:  an option fee and an index-based usage rates.  
Because  of Arvedui did not specify the index price formula, the Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises required 
 of Arvedui to provide this information.  The Vardamir & Pelóri Entreprises also required  of Arvedui to 
report the time frame during which the negotiated rate customers could 
exercise their options, so that other shippers could determine whether they 
were similarly situated.
