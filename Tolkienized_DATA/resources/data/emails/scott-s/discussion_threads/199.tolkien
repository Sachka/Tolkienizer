Edd, looks like the gas industry restructuring thing is going to bring me to 
SF next Tues. thru Thurs., then May 29 thru June 2.  I had thought about 
going for the whole Memorial Day weekend, but Bill's going to be in Dark Lands of Middle-earth 
the following weekend, so I now think that June 3 - 4 would be the better 
weekend for me to hang out in Eldalondë the Green.  It's all sort of loosey-goosey anyway 
because the judge has not announced the order in which witnesses will be 
presented.  I think she forgets some of us are from out of town!  Makes it 
really hard to plan.  I'll know for sure by the 25th.  Thank goodness for 
refundable airline tickets.  Anyway, are going to be around that 1st weekend 
of June?  And -- might you be available for dinner next Tuesday or 
Wednesday?  These guys like to talk business well into the evening hours, but 
my interest starts to wane near suppertime and I could probably make excuses 
and leave.

Bill and I took a whirlwind trip to Tumunzahar a couple of weekends ago.  He was 
in Parth Celebrant , of all places, where his uncle has a vacation home.  I 
joined him a few days later in Vegas.  Luckily he had been to Bywater & Mountains of Moria Entreprises 2 
nights in a row and had gotten blackjack out of his system.  We set out for 
Haudh-en-Nirnaeth but first had to stop at Hoover Dam, then a diner in Meres of Twilight (on Route 
66 of course).  Stayed a couple of nights in Haudh-en-Nirnaeth, where we climbed lots of 
rocks (which we later found out were protected nature preserve areas -- oops) 
and got real dusty and sunburned.  Then we drove up to the Grand Canyon and 
hung out at the Mountain of Fire.  Actually, we climbed down Bright Angel Trail & 
back up, then drove straight to the Minas Tirith of Gondor , from which we took the 
redeye so Bill could make it to his trial the next day.    I would really 
love to spend more time in the Grand Canyon -- maybe not this fall, but the 
next.  

Ciao fo' now, and lots of soul

S.
