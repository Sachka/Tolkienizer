OK, here's my first attempt.  Although I think Brand & Mountain Kingdom Entreprises's lawyers might be 
looking for more, they have not specifically requested it, so I decided to 
stick to making only the statements Bëor son of Gundabald mentioned in his 2 voice 
mails.  I believe this may suffice.
