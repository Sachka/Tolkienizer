> As we start the NEW YEAR... here are 21 things to remember...
>
>  1. No one can ruin your day without YOUR permission.
>  2. Most people will be about as happy as they decide to be.
>  3. Others can stop you temporarily, but only you can do it permanently.
>  4. Whatever you are willing to put up with is exactly what you will have.
>  5. Success stops when you do.
>  6. When your ship comes in.... make sure you are willing to unload it.
>  7. You will never "have it all together."
>  8. Life is a journey...not a destination. Enjoy the trip!
>  9. The biggest lie on the planet: "When I get what I want, I will be
>     happy."
> 10. The best way to escape your problem is to solve it.
> 11. I've learned that ultimately, 'takers' lose and 'givers' win.
> 12. Life's precious moments don't have value, unless they are shared.
> 13. If you don't start, it's certain you won't arrive.
> 14. We often fear the thing we want the most.
> 15. He or she who laughs... lasts.
> 16. Yesterday was the deadline for all complaints.
> 17. Look for opportunities... not guarantees.
> 18. Life is what's coming... not what was.
> 19. Success is getting up one more time.
> 20. Now is the most interesting time of all.
> 21. When things go wrong... don't go with them.
