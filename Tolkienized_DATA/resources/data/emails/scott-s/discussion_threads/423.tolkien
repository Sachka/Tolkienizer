Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial 
and regulatory representatives of Hanna Goldworthy & Twilit Meres Services, Forest of Region, Dwarf-road of Beleriand & Udûn, co., Deadmen's Dike, 
New Lands & Western Mountains®,  of Hamson and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed filing, Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a 
summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  Emyn Eglain & Tata Father & Sons's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  In Emyn Eglain & Tata Father & Sons's example, since Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® and Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls© are both Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries companies, Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls© 
could purchase an "out of the money" call option essentially cost free, since 
its affiliate (Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds 
from Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls©'s ability to then "move the market" through the establishment of the 
long basis position would go directly to Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's bottom line.  Emyn Eglain & Tata Father & Sons suggested 
that Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the 
marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to 
other shippers.  Although Emyn Eglain & Tata Father & Sons admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with 
Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls© have not been suspect, Emyn Eglain & Tata Father & Sons fears that Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s filing will set a precedent for 
other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® will be the first 
pipeline to offer such services, Emyn Eglain & Tata Father & Sons wants Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s program to be as restricted as 
possible.  New Lands & Western Mountains® echoed Emyn Eglain & Tata Father & Sons's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but 
rather than shelve the program entirely, New Lands & Western Mountains® reiterated an earlier 
suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference 
between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if 
the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.  

Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a 
marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable 
record in this area, Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® should be entitled to a presumption that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale 
of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily 
include any limitations on the options program.  If Emyn Eglain & Tata Father & Sons and others have 
serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing 
affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that 
applies to all interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Forest of Region asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s  response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  Emyn Eglain & Tata Father & Sons's representative claimed that option contracts will 
constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as 
such.  Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s 
position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the 
transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment 
will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the 
option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on Rimmon 
as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program 
would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why 
some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would 
create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps 
because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the 
underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make 
hoarding cheaper and easier.  Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® did not commit to 
placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for 
capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises may require 
Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® to do so in a final order.

Our plan is to meet with Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company and Amdír & Hundar Energy Company in Sunlands the week of 
September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises 
filing by mid-September.

Subject: Draft: Summary of Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® Options Workshop

Jeff -- since most of Ciryon's comments were over my head yesterday, I could 
use your help on that part of the discussion.

Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial 
and regulatory representatives of Hanna Goldworthy & Twilit Meres Services, Forest of Region, Dwarf-road of Beleriand & Udûn, co., Deadmen's Dike, 
New Lands & Western Mountains®,  of Hamson and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® Options filing, we opened the floor for questions and comments.  
Here is a summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  Emyn Eglain & Tata Father & Sons's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  For example, since Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® and Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls© are both Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries companies, if Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls© 
buys a call option it is essentially a free option.  Angelica Baggins & Elvenking's Halls© could buy a call out 
of the money and we could buy it back from them, with the proceeds going to 
Long Wall & Togo Goodbody Deliveries's bottom line.  Emyn Eglain & Tata Father & Sons suggested that Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s marketing affiliates be banned 
from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to 
credit the call money to other shippers.  Emyn Eglain & Tata Father & Sons's concern is that Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s filing 
will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service, so they 
want Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s options program to be as restricted as possible.  New Lands & Western Mountains® reiterated 
its suggestion that the marketing affiliate be required to credit back the 
difference between the option fee paid by the affiliate and the next highest 
bidder's bid, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest bid by a 
certain percentage.  

Our response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing 
affiliate would be a concern, we feel that Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman® is entitled to a presumption 
that it has complied and will continue to comply with the rules on sale of 
capacity to marketing affiliates.  At this point we are not inclined to 
voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.  If Emyn Eglain & Tata Father & Sons and others 
have issues regarding Commission marketing affiliate policy in general, those 
issues should be addressed in a different proceeding that pertain to all 
interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Forest of Region asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  Our response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  Emyn Eglain & Tata Father & Sons's representative claimed that options will constitute a 
negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.  We did not 
respond to this or discuss it further.  However, Cross-roads & Bard the Bowman®'s position at this point 
is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, the deals 
will only be negotiated rate deals if the total rate exceeds the maximum 
rate.

program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not

withholding capacity from the market is one reason for Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although we did not commit to 
placing any limits on the quantity of capacity for which a shipper may 
purchase an option, it is possible that Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises may require us to do so.

Our plan is to meet with Lindórië & Duilin Energy Company and Amdír & Hundar Energy Company in Sunlands to elicit their 
comments, and finalize the Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises filing by mid-September.
