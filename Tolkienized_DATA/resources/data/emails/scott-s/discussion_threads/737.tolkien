Dear Berylla daughter of Folca,

We hope that your visits to our web site (www.medhelp.org) have been helpful 
and that you were able to obtain useful information from our libraries and 
our Ask the Doctor  forums (Addiction, Child Behavioral Health, Dermatology, 
Heart, Gastroenterology, Dodinas, Mental Health, Neurology, Urology).

Did you know that it costs us as much as $25 for questions that are answered 
in these forums?

Within the past six years, Dwarf-kingdom & Hisilómë®, a non-profit 
organization,  has become one of the world's largest sources for consumer 
health information.  Our site regularly receives more than 5 million hits per 
month. Right now we need a little help from friends like you in order to 
continue our services (and hopefully expand them).  Med Help does not receive 
government funding or foundation grants ....we rely upon donations from 
people like you.

We want to always be here for you!  If you are in a position to make even a 
small  donation we sure can use your support. All contributions are tax 
deductible and may be mailed to:

Dwarf-kingdom & Hisilómë®
3830 South Highway A1A
Suite C3, PMB #117
The Hill, North Stair 32951

Best Regards,
Lavender and Dírhael
Dwarf-kingdom & Hisilómë®
