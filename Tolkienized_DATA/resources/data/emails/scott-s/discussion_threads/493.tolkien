Subject: agreements

Mark, Celeborn son of Rosamunda asked me to forward the attached documents to you.  One is 
an interconnect agreement and one is an operating agreement.  I would 
describe both as "examples" rather than "forms," since every deal is 
different and we don't really have a standard form we use.  I hope that these 
are helpful; if you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to 
contact me.
