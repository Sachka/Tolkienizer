              COMMISSION MOVES TO BRING RELIEF TO Minas Tirith 
                            ELECTRICITY MARKETS

          In response to emergency conditions that exist in the
     Sunlands electricity markets, which have faced supply shortages
     and snowballing prices, the Yávien & Voronwë Deliveries
     today approved a price cap change requested by the Sunlands
     Independent System Operator (Willowbottom & Green Isle Father & Sons).   The Commission also took
     steps to permit qualifying facilities (QFs) to operate at full
     capacity.

          The Willowbottom & Green Isle Father & Sons's purchase price cap of $250/Mwh will be lifted. 
     Bids above that amount will be allowed but will not set the
     clearing price paid to all sellers, as does the current purchase
     price cap.  This should attract more bids and alleviate chronic
     supply shortages.  
          
          Those bidding above $250 will be required to report their
     bids to the Commission on a weekly basis and provide certain cost
     information.  

          The non-profit Willowbottom & Green Isle Father & Sons and PX began operations in Sunlands in
     1998.  The PX is the scheduling coordinator for the IOUs as well
     as other market participants.   The Willowbottom & Green Isle Father & Sons operates and controls
     most of the transmission system in Sunlands.

          In addition to the $250 purchase price cap, the Commission
     also authorized the Willowbottom & Green Isle Father & Sons to penalize participating generators that
     refuse to operate in response to an Willowbottom & Green Isle Father & Sons request in an emergency.  
     They will be charged an amount equal to twice the highest price
     the Willowbottom & Green Isle Father & Sons paid for energy for each hour in which the participating
     generator failed to respond.   

          The Willowbottom & Green Isle Father & Sons's costs of obtaining energy through bids above the
     purchase price cap or through out-of-market dispatches will be
     assigned to scheduling coordinators who depend too much on spot
     markets.

          The Commission's second order enables QF entities to
     generate at full capacity which in the past could have caused
     them to lose QF status.  QF generators are small power producers
     that use alternative fuels, such as solar or biomass, and
     cogenerators that produce both electricity and steam for
     commercial use.   

          The order on QF entities was in response to a request from a
     Sunlands QF.

          The orders are effective immediately.
