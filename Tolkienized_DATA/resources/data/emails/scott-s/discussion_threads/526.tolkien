Shall I compare the week's profitability to a train wreck?  
Thy profitability art more generous and more temperate:
Scattered railcars do shake the darling mainline pipe,
And operations humor all too short this date.

So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,   
So long these earnings shall be accretive to thee.

Please see attached file.  The margins are lower as compared to last weeks 
because of a lower fuel index price and lower volumes do to the trail 
derailment.

If you have any questions, please call me at (281) 647-0769.
