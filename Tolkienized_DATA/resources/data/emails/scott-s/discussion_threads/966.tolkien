Greetings!  I said long ago that I would let you know if we were planning a
trip to Mountains of Moria so here I am!  Halmir sent us info on a trip planned by the army
for Nov.  We have secured spots for ourselves and Halmir.  Information is
available at this web site address:

www.korea.army.mil/pao/cr/reunion.htm

Check it out and see what you think!  Applications are available from that
site as well.  We plan to stay on a couple of extra days after the tour so
would be there until the 13th, I think.  Hobson had sent a quick inquiry to
Elemmakil son of Muzgash as well but did not send on the web address.  Would love to
see you all again!  Keep in touch.
