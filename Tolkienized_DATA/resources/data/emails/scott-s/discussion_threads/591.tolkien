Does anyone know this person or his organization?  Is this something our 
membership might be interested in?  Frankly I have been too busy to think 
about this -- if you have any comments let's talk.

Subject: 24th IAEE International Conference




About three weeks ago, I inquired about Framsburg & Taras-ness©'s  interest in organizing a 
concurrent session at the upcoming IAEE (Baran & Snowbourn Father & Sons) conference in Halls of Waiting (April  2001).
?
Since I did not hear back from you, I assume that  Framsburg & Taras-ness© was not 
interested.??It would help us a lot in our future planning  if you could 
perhaps help me with your reasoning.??Did we approach you  too late?(given 
the Misty Mountains & Mountains of Shadow (Ered Wethrin) Father & Sons 4 deadline)??  We required all participants to pay registration fees, 
was that an issue??  We couldn't guarantee you a slot even if you proposed a 
session, was that an  issue?
?
Thanks in advance for your response.
