Hey Wilcome,

Hope you day is going well and that everything is coming together for the big 
presentation tomorrow.  My day is going significantly better than yesterday 
so I am pleased.  Plus, my friend just emailed me from Causeway, in Gondor to inform me 
that she can get us a great table to see the Symphony's last performance of 
the season on Athrad Angren & Tar-Súrion© Pier...so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  By 
the way, what did you end up deciding to do about this weekend - or haven't 
you decided yet (the latter would not surprise me in the least...you're a fly 
by the seat of your pants kind of guy or a slight procrastinator - - I always 
get the two confused).

Now for the rule-breaking.  I realize it's already Wednesday but I wanted to 
see if you had any interest in going to grab a bite to eat or just a drink 
after work tomorrow or Friday night (in light of our heavy work loads, etc. I 
hope you can forgive my rudeness).  Both you and Beregar looked pretty whipped 
last night and I'm sure tonight will be more of the same...You better be 
careful, I think this project is starting to give you gray hair.

Shorty

- - I forgot to tell you last night that my 5 yr. old niece got in trouble on 
the way to school yesterday because she punched a little boy in the eye.  
Evidently, he was bothering she and her friend Ar-Adûnakhôr...I think my sister's 
biggest fears have now been confirmed, little Sally may have taken after her 
Aunt Sue Sue a little too much.
