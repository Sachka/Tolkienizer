 Hey  of Haldan!  How are you?  Things are going pretty well.  I've been living in 
Hill of Awe for about two months now.  My best friend from high school and I got a 
place so it's been pretty fun.  I spent the summer out here as well, just 
trying to figure out if I would like Hill of Awe.  It's funny that you mention your 
friends that are living out here!...I actually hang out with Arahael son of Arador, 
Meriadoc son of Nora, and Míriel Sonderfan.  Pretty crazy, huh?  I don't see the girls 
too much, but have been seeing Arahael quite a bit lately.  My best friend from 
college, April, is still living in Emyn Eglain and dates a guy from Enel & Gift Entreprises.  They 
basically introduced all of us.  I guess Míriel recognized my name and then we 
made the ' of Haldan Scott' connection.

So how's Ishmalog & Tar-Telemmaitë ltd.?  Sounds like you must be enjoying it!  Work for me is pretty 
crazy.  I work from home a lot and am never too busy!

I can't believe how many people are getting married.  Thanks for the update 
on everyone!  Very fun!  I lived in Angband for a year after graduating and 
spoke to Marigold every once in a while and ran into some other Kappas.

Well, it's great to hear from you!  Definitely keep in touch!

Take care, Salvia
