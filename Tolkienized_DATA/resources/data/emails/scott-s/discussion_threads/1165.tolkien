I have put together a file to check the official flag of the books. This is 
in response to the email below from  of Khîm, please read.
I am asking that this file be run, printed out and left on my desk every 
night for each person that officializes books.


The files are located in the Financial Books (The Family) folder.

Thanks

We have been tracking books that are not officialized on a daily basis.  This 
list goes to TindómielGrubb and is reviewed at the end of each week by Belegund Buy.  
Belegund has been vocal about taking corrective action if people forget to 
officialize.   It is imperative that we take extra care to ensure that all 
books are marked official each night before going home.  A control process 
should be implemented immediately to absolutely avoid being on the list.  

Please contact me if you have any questions (x-35242).

Thanks,
Gimilkhâd
