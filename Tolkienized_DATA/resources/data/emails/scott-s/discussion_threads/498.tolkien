Aredhel, attached is the request for rehearing that needs to be filed today.  
Please print it out, sign my name and fax it to Goldilocks LaGesse at 
713-853-5425.  When my staff meeting is over at around 10:30 I'll take a look 
at it and give you a call.
By the way, I don't usually bother with a cover letter but if you believe one 
is needed, let me know.
Thanks!
