And we're coming to Halls of Waiting!

Yeah! I am really looking forward to our trip to Halls of Waiting this year! Got you 
message over Thanksgiving, hope you had a great (long) weekend! We stayed in 
town and helped out at the Amandil & Cerin Amroth® then tried to find a 
Lindon dinner to eat... nothin' like eatin' at a restaurant for 
Thanksgiving... :(

We are planning to arrive in Halls of Waiting on Thursday the 21st and return back to 
LA on Tuesday the 26th. We'd love to get together with you (and your beau?) 
on Friday if you're still in town and are available! Mark and I love to trek 
downtown and see how the rest of the city lives outside of Caves of Menegroth. Let 
me know if that works for you.

Hope you're having a good week. Talk to you soon, Sue
