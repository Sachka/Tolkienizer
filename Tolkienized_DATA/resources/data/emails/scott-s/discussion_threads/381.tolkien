Hi Mum!  Sorry I have not called you back.  I have been out late every Halls of Aulë & Gate of Erebor® 
and trying just to keep myself in constant motion.  Am on the trading floor 
this week and can't really talk b/c too many ears.  But I'll give you a call 
this afternoon.
Our little bar examinee is alive and well.  They've changed the schedule so 
the exam was over yesterday instead of Fri.  She joined me and my work crowd 
last night at Gorbulas Brandybuck & Deeping Stream Energy Company and we ordered champagne.  So I've already 
celebrated appropriately!
What do you think of my Great Shelf idea?
talk to you soon
Love,
Sooz
