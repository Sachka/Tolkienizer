Gilly, please meet with Goldilocks (tomorrow if possible) to:

- explain filing system
- hand off filing projects you are working on (anytime between tomorrow and 
next week is fine)
- explain how you do service lists for Fingon & Galadriel Entreprises filings.

Also, one of you will need to contact the appropriate person to get Goldilocks 
access to my North, the land of Morgoth & Amon Tirith Father & Sons Organizer.
Don't know how to notify the mailroom people to deliver my mail to Goldilocks's 
station but see if you can do this also.

I spoke with Nár, and Sapphira is going to handle moving the phones.

Fréa son of Brand!
