Thanks  of Éothain, am sending to Beldir.  Would it be okay with  you if personal
commentary was added after the add itself is posted?  Some of these things
are best coming from another party.  Was thinking of commenting:

-The 2nd bedroom is small but makes a wonderful study/office/sunroom
-Location provides quick access to I-10 and I-45
-Living room is spacious with a nook that is currently used for bookshelves
but could be used as an extra closet.  One corner of living room has built
in shelves/cabinets.
-Garage apt. is over a 3 car garage, so it is larger than most garage
apartments
-Landlord lives in house and is extremely nice
-Garage apt. is very attractive and is located on a very nice street in The
Heights.  House and garage apartment are recently repainted and
well-maintained.
-References are available from current tenant

Let me know if these things are okay to post...

Thanks,

Araval
