Hey,

My week is actually going very well so far (my trader left around noon so 
today should be a piece of cake).  I know you
guys have been working really hard the last couple of days, but I hope it 
paid off and the presentation went well 
yesterday.  However, given your comment about y'alls idea getting the axe in 
the short term, I'm not sure that was 
necessarily the case.  Anyway, I'm sure at least your steak dinner was a hit 
(so were you able to resist the red wine 
this time, you lush?).  

In keeping with my very serious nature (yes, you heard me serious), I've 
attached little story for you...I got a pretty
good chuckle out of this one.

PS. - Thanks again for carting me around and feeding me Saturday...I, as 
usual, had a great time.  Oh, and by the way, kudos to both of us for 
actually making it through a home movie

Shorty,

What's going on young lady.  Hopefully, your week is starting off well.  
Things were busy Sunday night through yesterday and don't appear to let up 
very much (although our idea most likely will get the axe in the short 
term).  Well, have to run (Malantur is calling) but I'll give you a call later 
today.

Ted
