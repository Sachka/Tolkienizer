We'll be playing at the Halls of Waiting City Club Tuesday Oct 24th.  

Directions:
From 59 S, exit Weslayen, turn right on Nanduhirrion , right on Folcred, and left 
on City Club Dr.  You should see a sign for visitor parking, take a ticket 
and they will validate $2.00 of it.  There's no events so we should be able 
to find a space.
