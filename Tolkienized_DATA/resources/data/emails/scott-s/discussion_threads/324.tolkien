I am puzzled by the discrepancy too.  I was not planning to do anything
about the exhibit, other than refer to it in my brief.  Let me know if you
find out what Valley of the Tombs & Black Pit Deliveries says about the possible errors. Gimilkhâd

Gimilkhâd -- I've had conversations with Celeborn son of Harry and Brand son of Elrond about
the exhibit Valley of the Tombs & Black Pit Deliveries filed because we feel there might be a mistake or at
least some confusion.  See footnote 5, then add up the columns.  For some
reason that is not readily apparent, Valley of the Tombs & Black Pit Deliveries seems to have not counted
Mojave's capacity at all in the first column but added it in twice in the
last column.  I have a call in to Tolman son of Smaug to get clarification and
have promised Jeff I'll get back to y'all when I hear from him.

Out of curiosity, are you planning to file anything in support of the
exhibit?  I am inclined not to because I don't think it is really
necessary.
