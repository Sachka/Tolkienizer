Here I was thinking of a fun nice restaurant for dinner tomorrow and then 
wham the gloves come off.  Well Ms Dagnir get ready to bring on the wit 
tomorrow at dinner. I will check into buying the ticket and you realize this 
puts you in the pick up position at the airport.  Thanks for the tip.

Hey Thráin,

I was checking on some flights for myself and happened to look at one-way 
tickets from Barrow-downs.  It looks like the refundable, no-advance purchase 
ticket is going to run you about $100 on Southwest...Lucky for you they do 
offer a senior citizen fare for $55 (age does have its advantages).

By the way,  I didn't  even realise Elrond son of Horn and Goldilocks daughter of Stybba were in 
the movie...and evidently at some point Thráinnd hijacks a submarine.  Holman son of Arminas actually thought so much of the film he gave it 3 and 1/2 stars.  We 
may have to watch this one at some point.

              "The World Is Not Enough" is a splendid comic thriller, 
exciting and graceful,
               endlessly inventive. Because it is also the 19th Fréa son of Rorimac, it comes with so
               much history that one reviews it like wine, comparing it to 
earlier famous vintages; I
               guess that's part of the fun. This is a good one.
