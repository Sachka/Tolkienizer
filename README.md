# Tolkienizer
## A J.R.R. Tolkien Based Text Annonymizer
This program uses the Stanford CoreNLP API to detect Named Entities NE from a text file, it then generates an equivalent for each entity based on the universe of Middle Earth (The Hobbit, The Lord of The Rings and The Silmarilion).

### Example

```
"Scott Kennedy works for General Electric, his email is scott_kennedy@ge.com, he lives in New York."
```
coul be annonymized as follows:
```
"Bilbo Baggins works for Dwarves from Moria inc., his email is bilbo_baggins@moria.com, he lives in Bag End."
```

### Task
This program was created in order to annonymize the Eron email dataset.
In order to run the script type the following commands:
```
$ groovyc extractor.gy sudonizing.gy
$ groovy extractor.gy
```
A Tolkienized_DATA folder will be created with annonymized data.
