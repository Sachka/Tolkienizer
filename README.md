# Tolkienizer
## A J.R.R. Tolkien Based Text Annonymizer
This program uses the Stanford CoreNLP API to detect Named Entities NE from a text file, it then generates an equivalent for each entity based on the universe of Middle Earth (The Hobbit, The Lord of The Rings and The Silmarilion).

** EXAMPLE **

"Scott Kennedy works for General Electric, his email is scott_kennedy@ge.com, he lives in New York."
coul be annonimized as follows:
"Bilbo Baggins works for Dwarves from Moria inc., his email is bilbo_baggins@moria.com, he lives in Bag End."

This program was created by Hermes Martinez, Timoth√©e Mickus and Xining Li in order to annonymize the Eron email dataset.
